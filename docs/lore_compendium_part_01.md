# Adelaide Dawntreader
## Summary
Adelaide Dawntreader is a High Elf mage PC played by Julia. Her familiar Lu'va usually takes the form of a siamese cat. Her father Ma'themar Dawntreader was an ambassador to Lordaeran, with Leodis Skybearer serving as his assistant. She is not very close to her mother, Saridel Dawntreader. Adelaide relies a little heavily on alcohol to get through some parts of her past and present. Adelaide has a very stoic personality, and does not open up a lot about her feelings (although she has revealed she is open to an occasional cuddle with Isi). However, she is wise and intelligent, having been classically educated on magic and history and many other things beside. She is a Bladesinger, and is versed both in fighting magically and with use of her weapon.
## Background
Adelaide was born in Silvermoon to Ma'themar and Saridel Dawntreader. Adelaide's twin sister Mina (whom she had first described to the party as a childhood friend) died of an unknown illness when they both were 42. Adelaide has said she was not very close to her mother Saridel. She left Silvermoon shortly before the massacre and Sunwell destruction, and was not aware of any of the events that happened in Silvermoon after her departure, as evidenced in her conversations with Isilee. At some point after her departure it is known that she worked on a ship.
We know that Adelaide was not good enough to be a Bladesinger/in the Bladesinger program so she stole the knowledge and did it on her own #bossbitch
Recently, Addy got super drunk and in a blackout called Isi "Ilssa"?? We have yet to uncover who this could be, but the onion will be peeled back mark my words! Update: Ilssa was her roommate! She became a bladesinger. They had a bit of a situationship goin
### Ratchet Arc
Adelaide was at the Broken Keel Tavern when she was recruited by a group of Bruisers discussing a reward offered by Gazlowe for hunting down the South Sea Freebooters. At the tavern, she teams up with Ga'an and sets out to find the pirate camp. They are caught and imprisoned quickly. When they are imprisoned, they meet Isilee, a Blood Elf rogue, and Alyrin, a Forsaken Night Elf priest, who were set on a similar path, with the stipulation that they also rescue useless elf Gilthares Firebough. With the combined force of the full party, the group is able to make it out of the pirate camp, and successfully returns Gilthares to his cousin. Isilee and Alyrin had made a similar deal with Captain Brightsun that granted them passage north; Adelaide and Ga'an joined them on the trip.
### Ragefire Arc
The party arrives at Bladefist Bay and makes their way to Orgrimmar. Alyrin is promptly kidnapped; the party rescues her, and meets her assailant, Jes'rimon. Jes'rimon tasks the group with investigating some disappearances and some murmurs of the revival of an organization known as the Burning Blade. Adelaide and Isilee bond during this time over shared homes and traumas. The group heads to Ragefire Chasm, known to be the home base of the Burning Blade. During this time Adelaide's health appears to suffer as she brought an insufficient supply of alcohol for the numerous days spent in the cave system. Adelaide survives a surprisingly lethal rope climb down a cliff face. After the group finds Uto Broadedge, an orc to whose mate Juniper swore that she would locate him, Adelaide argues to the party that they should head back; she is convinced to push farther forward in the hopes that they will discover more about the Burning Blade for Jes'rimon. Adelaide is yeeted into the lava later in this same session, which definitely doesn't make her regret that decision. Adelaide notices that Taragamon's blade, which glows in the presence of Fel magic, glows a bit brighter when near Isilee.
After falling into lava a couple more times, Adelaide and the party exit Ragefire Chasm. They meet with Jes'rimon to discuss their findings and are later attacked by assassins in the night. Jes'rimon also was a victim of this attack, and the party decides to confront the issue head on by interrogating Nekros. This goes badly. Next, the group decides to interrogate orc Harkzog in the Valley of the Brave. To do so, Adelaide assumes the form of a troll child that she names Ba'an in order to distract the guards from the illicit activities of Isilee, Juniper, Alyrin and Ga'an. The results of this attempted interrogation are disastrous, with the group kidnapping Harkzog and getting tracked back to Jes'rimon's hideout, exposing him. As a last resort the party goes to confront Neeru directly. During this battle Adelaide is killed, with her soul trapped in a soul gem by Neeru. She is revived through Alyrin's magic and the power of the memories that the party has of their time together.
After the dust settles, Jes'rimon summons Adelaide on a secret mission of her own to complete separate from the party. As she later reveals to the party, this mission consisted of the investigation of several cultists, along with a troll named Kanyi, who she later re-encounters during Isilee's kidnapping by Cinder Sharpflyer.
### First Home Arc
Adelaide's return joyously coincides with the party's arrival in Sen'jin Village. The group meets with Ga'an's family, as well as several other village elders. One of these includes Mother Norn'sa, a soothsayer residing in the town. Norn'sa gives Ga'an guidance upon his visions and upon his quest to First Home, before giving advice to the rest of the party members as well-- to Adelaide, she says 'Mina misses you', which upsets Adelaide and causes her to leave the house. Isilee follows her out, where Adelaide confesses to her that after Mina's death, everything felt completely meaningless, and that she broke when Mina died. Isilee comforts her and they drink together. The party makes their way to Orgrimmar and then to Darkspear Isles via boat. Adelaide makes sure to communicate their activities back to Jes'rimon by Scintilla's delivery service. On board, Adelaide meets fellow Blood Elf Velarise, and is a little snobby toward her about the farming community she hails from.
The party dives down and begins investigating the isles. Adelaide discovers a number of interesting structures, including some of clear Night Elven origin, prior to the separation of Night Elves and High Elves. The city appears to have sunken before the Sundering. After an encounter with a ghost child and a sea witch, Adelaide discovers the ruins of what appears to be some sort of academic building. Adelaide investigates, and discovers a magic box and a gem that seems to have a strange pull on her. The party make their way to First Home, where they all undergo the trials set before them. Adelaide attempts to contact Athian on the ship, but the signal is distorted; she realizes that the place that they have entered is on another plane of existence, which is interfering with the magic of the sending stones. After Ga'an and Isilee vanish during one of these trials, Adelaide, Juniper, and Alyrin decide to all sit back to back at high alert in a clearing until they return.
As they are leaving First Home, Adelaide and Isilee have a heart to heart-- Isilee about her fear that she will betray the party after her past decisions, and Adelaide's fears about the gem she found in the Academy ruins that has a dark pull on her. She gives the gem to Isi for safekeeping. The group makes their way back to the boat. Adelaide summons a Major Image of a Kraken to distract the Mur'gul forces as the party snuck out past them. During this battle, Adelaide manages to contact the ship, letting Athena know that they were in fact alive and coming back up. As they are on the way out, Alyrin and Juniper propose a investigation of a building that looks like it is an armory; Adelaide is opposed, but is outvoted, and allows the group twenty minutes, beginning a second-by-second countdown the moment the vote ends. The group at long last arrives back at the boat. Once onboard, the gem Adelaide has a strange connection to is identified as an elemental mote of arcana.
### Emerald Dream Arc
After their return, Adelaide partakes in the festivities of Wintervale, picking up an elven dreidel and a Sylvanas doll as a reward for a carnival game. She competes with the Gatekeepers in the competition at the Valley of the Brave, winning a fair sum of money and some nice bragging rights. Adelaide and Isilee learn that Kael'thas is no longer the leader of Silvermoon, which is news to them. The new leader, Lor'themar, is known by Adelaide, having met him in passing at dinners with her father. Adelaide is almost killed in a rescue attempt during Isi's kidnapping before her assailant-- Kanyi, the troll working with Jes'rimon-- recognizes her and heals her immediately.

# Alyrin
## Summary
Alyrin is a Forsaken (formerly Night Elf) priestess of Elune played by Theo. She was born shortly before the War of the Ancients. At the Battle of Mount Hyjal at the end of the Third War, she was slain and resurrected without control of her own mind. Eventually, she was freed of that influence but was unable to remember much of anything about her past life. During a near second-death experience, a vision of Elune granted her restored memories of her past, and her druid brother who she believes to be in trouble. Alyrin is the party healer and everyone would be dead 10x over without her. She maybe likes to eat dead bodies tho nbd
## Background
Alyrin was born a Night Elf during the Long Vigil, a period before the War of the Ancients. This was before the Sundering, in which Azeroth's continents were split apart. While she was too young to participate in the War of the Ancients, she does have memories of it occurring during her childhood. Alyrin has two siblings, a sister which she has shared little about and a brother who is a druid and member of the Cenarian Circle.
As an adult, Alyrin joined the priestesses of Elune and became a part of the Sentinels, a group of priestesses renowned for their abilities in combat. Alyrin fought in the War of Satyrs which occurred in the years after the Sundering. In more recent times, she fought in the Third War, where she fell at the Battle of Mount Hyjal defending Nordrassil. Following her death, she was raised by the Lich King as a Forsaken and conscripted into his army.
Under the influence of the Lich King, Alyrin had no free will or sense of self, a true Zombie in mind and body. The influence of the Lich King was eventually broken following his defeat. Alyrin regained autonomy, but retained no memories of her past life. She joined the Forsaken under Sylvanas Windrunner in the Undercity, beneath the ruins of Lordaeron. As time passed, she began to receive flashes of her former life. Though she could not remember most of the details, she regained enough to know of her brother, and understand that her visions warned of his life in danger. Alyrin set out to regain the rest of her lost memories and come to her brother's aid.
### Ratchet Arc
Alyrin found her way to the Broken Keel Tavern in Ratchet where she encountered Captain Brightsun, a Blood Elf captain requesting aid in rescuing his cousin Gilthares Firebough from the South Sea Freebooters. Alyrin overheard Brightsun's conversation with another Blood Elf, Isilee, and offered her services in exchange for passage North. Isilee and Alyrin proceeded to infiltrate the pirate camp together, finding their way to where Gilthares was being held prisoner, only to find themselves surrounded and taken prisoner.
Shortly after, Ga'an and Adelaide were taken prisoner as well and thrown into the same cell as Alyrin, Isilee, and Gilthares. The five freed themselves from their prison and fought their way out of the camp. Alyrin's memories were restored to her in a dream, of which she shared the basic details of with her new companions. In this dream, Elune spoke to her directly, guiding her on the path towards saving her brother.
### Ragefire Arc
While searching for evidence of Neeru Fireblade's connection to the Searing Blade, the GayteKeepërs tracked down and interrogated Nekros Clantaker of the Shadowswift Brotherhood. As part of this interregation, Alyrin severed one of Nekros' fingers, and failed to stabilize the wound after. This lead to Nekros' death while being transported to Yelmak's Alchemy in a wooden barrel. The following day, the party noticed Alyrin appeared grayer than normal and seemed to struggle with casting holy magic. Alyrin was initially confused by her faltering connection to Elune, but eventually came to realize it to be a result of her actions in the torture of Nekros. She then received a vision from Elune in which she was forced to fight the representation of her darkest parts. She succeeded in this trial and once more regained the favor of Elune.
During the confrontation with Neeru, Adelaide was struck down and her soul trapped in a soul gem. Alyrin successfully called on the power of Elune to both break her soul out of the gem and revivify Adelaide.
### First Home Arc
Alyrin and Ga'an traveled to the Valley of Spirits, seeking information on the druids and what might be endangering Alyrin's brother. They were told there that Emissary Blackhoof of the Cenarian Circle can provide them more information, and that he will be along shortly. Blackhoof found the GayteKeepërs at the Broken Tusk Tavern later that day. He spoke to the party of troubling instances of night elves not awakening from the Emerald Dream. The Circle is unsure of the nature of the issue, particularly as their leader, Malfurion Stormrage, has also fallen into a slumber from which he cannot be awakened. In his absence, Fandral Staghelm has stepped up as interim leader of the Cenarian Circle. Blackhoof offered for the party to accompany him to the Circle's stronghold in Moonglade, but cautioned that Fandril does not look kindly on non-druids, particularly the undead, entering Moonglade. The party declined the offer as Ga'an's business in First Home was more pressing, but received a letter from Blackhoof which should grant them access to the glade.

# Ga’an

# Ga’an
## Summary
Ga'an is a Darkspear Troll Witch Doctor PC played by Cade. His current home is Sen'jin Village, though he was born on the Darkspear Islands and has fond childhood memories of his time living on the The Echo Isles. His mother is an herbalist/alchemist who passed on the trade to him and his father was a hunter. Ga'an was mentored in the Witch Doctor arts by a Troll named Mozo're, later revealed to be the loa Gonk. Ga'an's goal is to grow more powerful so that he can defeat Zalazane, the witch doctor who seized the Echo Isles, abducted his father, and torments his village.
## Background
Ga'an was born on the island of Darkspear Island of Zul'dara to Molla and Cu'ul. His mother Molla was an alchemist and knowledgable in the field of herbalism, two skillsets which she passed down to Ga'an. Ga'an's father Cu'ul was a hunter, and trained Ga'an how to hunt, bestowing on a young Ga'an his first hunting knife made from the tooth of Cu'ul's first kill. Ga'an has one sibling, a younger brother named Volza.
When Ga'an was very young, several major events occurred on the Darkspear Islands in a short time. First, a race of green, brawny humanoids calling themselves Orcs made contact with the Darkspear Trolls. The Orcs were fleeing from the Eastern Kingdoms and arrived in peace, resulting in a friendly exchange between the two races. A week after the arrival of the Orcs, a fleet of Kul'Tiran ships attacked the island. The trolls successfully fended off the human invaders, only for a Sea Witch to arrive the same day and sink the Islands underneath the waves.
Ga'an and his family fled the sinking islands with the rest of the Darkspear Trolls, arriving on the The Echo Isles. Ga'an has fond memories of growing up on these isles, which were a tropical paradise. Ga'an would often spend time staring out at the water on "vision quests". This peaceful time was not long-lived, however, as the Trolls were once again forced out of their home, this time by one of their own. The witch doctor Zalazane seized control of the Isles, causing Ga'an's family to flee once more. They made a new home on the mainland across from the Echo Isles, founding Sen'jin Village.
Ga'an took an interest from a young age in the study of Loa and Witch Doctors. An elderly troll witch doctor calling himself Mozo're wandered into the village one day, and became a mentor figure to Ga'an. Cu'ul was skeptical of this mysterious man, and frowned upon the closeness between the two. He expressed to his son that if he had an interest in learning more about being a witch doctor, it would be best to learn from the town witch doctor, Gadrin. At some point before the start of the campaign, Mozo're left Sen'jin Village.
Zalazane did not leave the inhabitants of Sen'jin in peace. He orchestrated frequent raids in which many trolls were either killed or taken under the influence of his mind control. Zalazane also exhibited the power to raise the dead which he had slain. During one such raid, Molla was gravely injured, resulting in permanent loss of function in her legs. Ga'an was frozen in place from fear, while his younger brother stepped in to fend off the attacker and save the life of Ga'an and Molla. During this raid, Cu'ul was abducted and brought under the influence of Zalazane's mind control.
While many trolls have attempted to defeat Zalazane and liberate the Echo Isles, none have come back alive from their quest. Ga'an set out from Sen'jin Village to obtain the power to defeat Zalazane, no matter the cost.
### Ratchet Arc
After leaving Sen'jin Village, Ga'an found his way to the town of Ratchet in the Barrens. He was almost immediately thrown out of the Broken Keel Tavern for not having any money to pay for his drink. Upon being thrown out, Ga'an overheard a conversation between a group of Bruisers and the High Elf drinking at the bar, Adelaide. They spoke of a reward offered by Gazlowe for hunting down the South Sea Freebooters. Ga'an trailed behind Adelaide as she made her way to Gazlowe's home, and entered after her, agreeing to take on the job.
The two snuck into the South Sea Freebooters' camp alongside Retick Fiztorque, the captain of the Bruisers. The mission seemed to be going smoothly until Ga'an and Adelaide found themselves lead into a trap and surrounded. Retick revealed himself to have been working alongside Baron Longshore and the Freebooters from the start. Ga'an and Adelaide were manacled and thrown into a cell with three other prisoners. There they met Alyrin, Isilee, and the lamest jackass on Azeroth, Gilthares Firebough. The group managed to free themselves from their prison and take down Retick and Baron Longshore. Ga'an kept the baron's hat and cloak as a souvenier.
### Ragefire Arc
During the descent into Ragefire Chasm, Ga'an fell to his death while descending a shear cliff face. The shadows on the ground began to pour into him, reanimating his form. Ga'an awoke again with paler skin, black marks all along his body and the symbol of a skull on his chest. When questioned by the party, Ga'an denied having died at all and was evasive about his change in form. As they all continued further into Ragefire, he began dedicating his channeling to the loa of death, Bwonsamdi. Ga'an was evasive about this development as well, explaining simply that the loa of death is a good loa to worship given the death surrounding the party. Ga'an was struck down a second time in Ragefire Chasm, and once more revived by shadows. Ga'an did not open up until much later to admit that he made two deals with Bwomsamdi in order to return to living. The first deal he made was to defeat the Farraki, a group of trolls worshipping the old god of death, Ueetay no Mueh'zala. Bwomsamdi has first tasked Ga'an with journeying to First Home and undertaking the trials there that every witch doctor must do. No troll has completed this journey since the sinking of First Home alongside the rest of the Darkspear Islands nearly ten years ago. Bwomsamdi has yet to reveal to Ga'an what the second favor he requests of him will be, saying only that it will be revealed in time.
After defeating Neeru Fireblade and the Searing Blade, the GayteKeepërs were invited by Thrall to attend a feast in their honor. Here Ga'an met Vol’jin, the current leader of the trolls. Vol'jin and his closest friend, Zalazane, were the last to undertake the trials of First Home. Vol'jin called Ga'an a fool for wanting to take on Zalazane, and insists that if Ga'an is to have any hope of succeeding, he must first take on the trials at First Home. Vol'jin advised Ga'an that his greatest resource is the people he keeps around him, reminding him that the Darkspear Trolls would not be alive today if not for their friendship with the Orcs and Tauren.
### First Home Arc
The Gaytekeepërs embarked on their journey to Sen'jin Village in hopes of finding navigators who could lead them to the location of First Home. The party arrived at the village to find that it had just the night before come under attack. Ga'an rushed to his family's home, learning that his younger brother Volza had been gravely wounded in the raid and had lost a limb. While Volza was healing and expected to make a full recovery and full regeneration of his limb, his healing seemed to be impeaded by some dark magic or poison on the weapon which wounded him. Ga'an's mother Molla, wheelchair bound since the raid which took Ga'an's father, was delighted to see Ga'an but distressed by his change in appearance. When told of his dealings with Bwomsamdi, she was deeply concerned and insisted he seek out the council of the town witch doctor, Gadrin, as well as the seer Mother Norn'sa.
Gadrin cautioned Ga'an to be wary of Bwomsamdi and any deals he offeres. Mother Norn'sa provided a reading for Ga'an, fortelling of the dangers of First Home and an evil older than Azeroth itself which lies beneath the ocean. In this vision, Norn'sa projected the image of hundreds of burning orange eyes and a deep, booming voice with a simple warning: "WATCHING". Norn'sa warned that failure in Ga'an's quest would mean doom for the entire village. She cautioned that those who enter First Home leave as different trolls than they entered. Zalazane was given a choice there that set him on the path that he is on now. She warned that Ga'an will be given a similar choice.
The party enlisted the help of several sailors from Sen'jin, notably A'thian, Sam'gha, and Mi'zae. WIth their aid, the group charted a ship in Bladefist Bay named *The Jewel of the Horde*, a galleon operated by Captain Stormfang. With the aid of the Sen'jin naviagtors, the ship sailed for the Darkspear Islands. When the ship reached the general area of where the islands had sank, they found that the area was covered in a dense fog. Eminating from Ga'an's chest was a purple light, which guided them the rest of the way. After survivng a brush with an enormous whirlpool, the party made their way underwater to find First Home. Along the way, Ga'an visited his childhood hut on the island of Zul'dara and made offerings at the Temple of the Loa and the Tomb of the Old Ones, where Ga'an received the witch doctor mask of the late priest of Samedi.
The party managed to keep to the shadows after leaving the Tomb of the Old Ones, and finally came upon First Home, finding it to be encased in a mysterious bubble which the Naga could not enter. The Gaytekeepërs were granted passage into the bubble, and found themselves upon a sandy beach, once again breathing air instead of water. Inside First Home the group faced many trials, and Ga'an came to learn that his mentor Mozo're was in truth Gonk, the head of all the loa. Ga'an denied Dambala's offer of the power to defeat Zalazane and restore his mother's legs, asking if he took the offer, would his mother walk towards him, or run away? When the party had completed all the trials of First Home, Ga'an came once more upon his childhoot hut, as it would have been if not sunken under the tides. Inside he spoke to Bwomsamdi, learning that Gonk considered him a "chosen one", though he is neither the first nor the last. Before him the chosen ones were Vol'jin and Zalazane. Bwomsamdi cautioned Ga'an to not make the mistakes of Vol'jin, who allowed friendship to blind him to Zalazane's nature, a mistake that all Darkspear trolls must now pay the price for. Bwomsamdi also revealed that Zalazane's power comes from Ueetay no Mueh'zala, Defeating the Farraki trolls who worship him would greatly deprive Zalazane of his power.

# Isilee Shorestrider
_Source DB: Characters_

# Isilee Shorestrider
## Summary
Isilee is a half-eleven rogue PC played by Jordyn. Born in Lordaeron to Isidori a human prostitute, and Leodis Skybearer, a High Elf ambassador (assistant) from Silvermoon. Isilee spent her early childhood in Lordaeron but moved to live with her father in Silvermoon after her mother passed of illness (likely an STD). Isilee is the party's rogue, and has a particular affinity for daggers of all shapes and sizes. She is mischievous and enjoys sowing chaos in the party's adventures; however, she also cares deeply for her party members, often trying to get them to open up about their histories and share their experiences with the group.
## Background
Isilee was born in Lordaeron to Leodis Skybearer and Isidori. Isilee did not get along with her father, finding him distant, especially due to his time spent away for his work. Isilee was in Silvermoon during the High Elf Massacre but managed to survive, though she is unaware of whether her father did as well. After the massacre, Isilee took a job with another survivor who was a friend of her father's. Isilee's eyes were once purple, not green, and she believes it has something to do with the destruction of the Sunwell, though she isn't sure. At one point, Isilee was engaged to a man named Pietro, but she believes he tried to have her killed. She does miss that that they used to "murder, cuddle" (though these were two separate activities, note the comma). Pietro and Isilee were both employed by the spy organization Blades of the Sun under the supervision of Cinder Sharpflyer. At some point, they engaged in business with another spy organization known as Ravenhold. Isilee ran away from Blades of the Sun after completing her business with Ravenhold. However, her absence was made known to Cinder by Pietro, who presented him with a burn notice detailing Isi's activities and alleging that she was additionally spying on the Syndicate.
### Ratchet Arc
Isilee is approached while in the Broken Keel Tavern by Captain Brightsun, a Blood Elf captain requesting aid in rescuing his cousin Gilthares Firebough from the South Sea Freebooters. She teams up with an eavesdropping Forsaken Night Elf named Alyrin and they set off toward the pirate camp. Upon arrival, they are quickly taken hostage and were relieved of all of their personal possessions. Quickly after, another two are thrown in the cell with them-- troll shaman Ga'an and Blood Elf mage Adelaide. Using the abilities of the full group, they are able to all escape the pirate camp and rescue Gilthares. Isilee and the rest of the group returned Gilthares to Captain Brightsun and were granted passage north on his boat.
## Searing Blade Arc
The group is first investigated, and then tasked by Jes'rimon to aid in the efforts of the Shattered Hand to learn about the workings of the Burning Blade. During this time, Isilee discusses her past with the group, who learn that her father was not around a lot. Adelaide recognizes her father's name when spoken, but does not elaborate on her connection to it. Isilee and Adelaide form a close bond to the point that Isilee attempts to rob a component store for Adelaide, and is thoroughly beaten up by a magical rug and some other furniture and decoration, bestowing upon her a lifelong fear of furniture. The group heads on to Ragefire Chasm, the lava-ridden base of the Burning Blade. While in Ragefire, the group fights many monsters including Taragammon the Hungerer. Upon his defeat, it is noted by Adelaide that his blade, known to glow in the presence of Fel magic, glows brighter near Isilee. The party exits Ragefire and returns to tell Jes'rimon of their findings, where they are introduced to Whuut, who everyone immediately becomes obsessed with. That night, the group is attacked by assassins at the Broken Tusk Tavern, and Isilee is slipped a note instructing her to meet with the Shattered Hand urgently. Upon meeting with Jes'rimon it is discovered that he was the victim of an attack as well. The group vows to investigate Neeru and find out who did it. Alyrin and Isi apprehend a spy working for Nekros following them and interrogate him in a totally normal way. Following this the group goes to find Nekros and interrogate him, which they are mostly unsuccessful at doing. After a similarly blunderous encounter with Harkzog in the Hall of the Brave, the group decides to confront Neeru directly. This works and Neeru is taken into custody by Thrall. The party rests, recuperates, and celebrates at a feast thrown by Thrall in their honor; Isilee takes this opportunity to regale the attendees of the many heroic acts of the Gaytekeepers, asking for donations for their heroic deeds and Alyrin's basilisk therapy.
### First Home Arc
The party next ventures to Sen'jin Village, Ga'an's hometown. The party meets Ga'an's family and learns about the state of the village due to the recent raids. Isilee also convinces Ga'an's mother and half the town during this time that she is married to Ga'an and that actually so are Adelaide, Juniper, and Alyrin, and that the party is comprised of sisterwives. Isilee sells the item the Orb of Time to a magic items specialist in the village, successfully deceiving him that the item contained Wild Magic. However, the only ones that ended up being deceived were the party, as we had never identified the item and it was in fact Wild Magic for real. The party formulates a plan for transport to First Home, and prepares by speaking to several members of the village before boarding the ship. They travel to the location the Darkspear Isles should be and dive in, using Necklaces of Water speaking to avoid asphyxiation. At one point, the party is ambushed after resting in a temple by some creepy fish witches. The fish witches are winning the battle initially, killing or frog polymorphing everyone except Isilee. Isilee attempts to strike a deal with the fish witches and sweet talk them into letting the party go in exchange for a favor. The fish witches accept the deal and everyone is revived and healed. Ga'an and Alyrin are not amenable to the terms of the deal and renege, causing the fight to recommence, but this time the Gaytekeepers are victorious. The group make their way to a temple of all of the Loa, and begin to offer prayers to them in order to gain their favor before the trials ahead. Isilee specifically engages in a ritual for the Loa Elortha no Shadra, the spider goddess of spies. Upon reaching the island and in the midst of the island's trials, a will-o-the-wisp reveals Isilee's true name to be Anidori. Ga'an asks why she changed her name, at which point she reveals that she essentially betrayed everyone she knew in her past, including Pietro, and had to assume a new identity in an attempt to escape from the consequences of these actions. Isilee is given an audience with the spider goddess Shadra. During this interaction she is marked by the goddess in the form of a spider brand on her neck. This brand is revealed to be known as The Blessing of the Silk Dancer, which grants Isilee +2 to poison DCs as well as knowledge of 4 new poisons. The party leave First Home and successfully return to the ship. Isilee has collected 'mementos' (blood, sand, wood chips, an eyeball, bones) and enlists the rest of the party to help make it into a (very gross) memory candle for Ga'an.
### Emerald Dream Arc
After returning to Orgrimmar, the party engages in fun-filled Wintervale festivities (much to the chagrin of Juniper). One of these activities includes fighting in and winning a championship at the Valley of Strength. Isilee also won two rats in a shooting game at the festival, which she names Ga'an and Athian. After this championship, the group retires to the Broken Tusk Tavern, where Isilee and Alyrin notice two orcs staring at the party. Isilee goes to investigate, and is almost spelled by one of the orcs-- she is instructed to lose the rest of the party and go to Dark Earth Tavern, a place Alyrin had gone once before for normal mushrooms and absolutely nothing else. The group formulates a plan where Isilee would go toward the tavern normally and the rest would follow her invisibly behind. Isilee enters the tavern and is immediately captured by none other than Cinder Sharpflyer and his accomplices. Cinder had been told of Isi's exploits by Pietro, and deduced that she was around after Jes'rimon dropped a few clues about her identity unintentionally, but was unable to track her location until she appeared winning the championship earlier. He interrogated her about her activities with Ravenhold and she told him the truth-- she was involved with Ravenhold and spied for them on the Syndicate, but never worked against the Blades of the Sun. The rest of the group attempted a rescue but it turned out there was never any murdery intent on Cinder's part, and then everyone just had a nice discussion under the influence of truth serum before Cinder gave up and let us go home. Isilee revealed to the party later what she had left out of the discussion with Cinder-- she had wanted to leave Blades of the Sun and potentially begin working with Ravenhold but was unable to do so.

# Juniper
## Summary
Juniper is a Tauren hunter PC played by Jackie. Her animal companion is a pika named Stoga (short for Conastoga). Juniper is from the Stonetalon Mountains, though her clan is nomadic and didn't stay in one particular area. She left home as part of a Tauren coming-of-age custom in which she is meant to wander and see the world. She does not have a bull boyfriend (allegedly)
## Background
Juniper is from a nomadic clan of Tauren who reside in the Stonetalon Mountains. Her father is the chieftain of her clan, and her mother's occupation is unknown. She does not have any siblings. While most Tauren clans chose to leave behind their nomadic ways and settle in the newly established Thunder Bluff, Juniper's clan was one of the few who chose to keep the old nomadic ways. The clan still passes through the area as part of their annual migration path. Juniper's clan has a coming-of-age rite in which each Tauren is expected to leave the clan and see the world. There is no set goal or timeline on this rite, and Juniper is allowed to return home if she pleases.
### Ragefire Arc
Juniper traveled to Orgrimmar after leaving her clan and patronized the Broken Tusk Tavern. There she met a distressed Orc woman named Rasa who was searching for her missing mate, Uto. While comforting Rasa and trying to learn more about her mate's disappearance, Juniper was approached by the GayteKeepërs. The party took an interest in Rasa's story and joined forces with Juniper to investigate the disappearances. Juniper accompanied them into Ragefire Chasm and became an official member of the party.
### First Home Arc
Juniper encountered the ocean for the first time at Sen'jin Village and was amazed by its size. She also discovered that she becomes very seasick and struggled with the journey to the Darkspear Islands. Inside the Temple of the Loa, the party discovered a magical handaxe with the blessing of the loa Shirvala. Juniper took the weapon and seemed to grow stronger with it in her possession.
Shortly after entering First Home, Juniper cast *Speak with Animals* for the first time and conversed with her pet pika, Stoga. Stoga expressed to her that he hated the water and was terrified. Juniper was very private about this interaction and did not wish to discuss the exchange with the rest of the party.
Juniper was unintentionally injured by Isilee in one of the final trials of First Home. This caused her to become engulfed by mindless rage, attacking friend and foe alike. The party managed to subdue her, though not before she cleaved into Alyrin and Ga'an, knocking both party members unconscious. When she awoke chained and disarmed, she was still filled with fury, refusing to listen to the words of her friends and insisting on having her axe returned to her. Adelaide brought out the axe from the bag of holding, causing Juniper's gaze to immediately fixate on the weapon. Juniper continued to grow more and more agitated, forcing the party to knock her unconscious once more. Alyrin was able to call on the powers of Elune to sever the thread tying the axe to Juniper's life-force, breaking the curse. When Juniper awoke once more, she was free of the curse's influence, and apologized for the harm she had done.

# Party Goals Tracker
**Last Updated:** 10/27/2025
**Latest Session:** Session 64
**Arc: ** The Emerald Dream
## **🌀 Summary of Recent Events (Sessions 63–64)**
The Gaytekeepërs continued their northward journey through Ashenvale, following the guidance of Lieutenant Aeodira Thunderseeker toward Raynewood Retreat. After resting along the Fal’Farren River—the contested border between the Horde and the Alliance—the group observed the growing signs of military buildup and political tension between Horde factions. Tauren, Orcs, and Trolls stand united under a blood oath, while the Forsaken and Blood Elves remain uneasy allies.
Along the forest path, the party encountered Vinebeard, an ancient treant who watches over the woods. He confirmed that the darkness corrupting the forest—the same affliction tied to the Emerald Dream—had spread deep into the roots, gnawing at his mind with whispering voices. He did not know its source but warned of its growing reach.
Upon reaching the outskirts of Raynewood, the group met Watcher Daru, who directed them to Keeper Ordanus’ tower. There, they encountered Freyis, a dryad, and were offered lodging for the night before speaking with Ordanus in the morning. The Keeper was overheard debating with his sister, who urged him to remain hidden for his own safety. The session closed with the group preparing to consult Ordanus regarding the corruption—believed to be connected to the Emerald Nightmare.
## **Active Objectives:**
- Investigate and contain the corruption of the Emerald Dream.
  - Now confirmed by Vinebeard to be spreading beneath Ashenvale’s forests.
  - Keeper Ordanus may have insight into its nature or connection to the Nightmare.

  - His sister and fellow dryads appear to be protecting him from an unspecified danger.
- Escort Alyrin safely to the druids of Raynewood Retreat.
  - The group continues to travel cautiously due to Alyrin’s fragile condition following her resurrection.
- Monitor Horde and Alliance movements near the Fal’Farren River.

  - Potential future conflict may hinder travel or affect Cenarion neutrality.
- Support Ga’an’s spiritual trials.
  - Ga’an’s faith in Bwonsamdi continues to evolve, strengthened by his reflections on mortality and resurrection.

## **Relevant NPCs:**
- Vinebeard – Ancient treant guardian of the forest; aware of the corruption’s reach.
- Watcher Daru – Night Elf watchman at Raynewood’s gates.
- Freyis – Dryad attendant to Keeper Ordanus; offered lodging to the party.
- Keeper Ordanus – Druidic leader of Raynewood Retreat; suspected to be in hiding.

- The team returns to the Broken Tusk Tavern to find a team of guards and their Worgs investigating around the area (in pursuit of the thief who broke into the component shop, aka Isi)
- The party coats Isilee in onions to disguise her smell while Lu'va is made to smell like Isilee and sent off the other direction to lead the Worgs away.
- The party travels to the Darkfire Enclave to discuss the events with Neeru and get the Eradun missives translated. Neeru recognizes the insignia of Taragamon the Hungerer, a great Fel Guard of the Burning Legion. This could mean another demon invasion of Azeroth. 
- Neeru explains that the first warlocks were shaman, and that Fel drains life-force, leaving only mummified corpses
- The necklaces worn by the warlocks are called Searing Collars, which only work on Orcs but can amplify their Fel casting.
- Neeru translates the missives (which are still in code) for the party and says he will pay them for each searing collar they find
- After leaving Darkfire Enclave, the party are seen exchanging large amounts of money in an alley and are later ambushed (oops)
- Adelaide finds drugs :)
- The party speak to Jes'rimon again and learn of the Searing Blade, a sect of the Burning Blade, who have taken up residence in Ragefire Chasm.
- Jes'rimon has obtained a key for decoding the missive and discovers that it is a letter addressed to Gazz'uz. The letter details a recruitment plan for targetting orc shaman and low-ranking military recruits. Skull rock, where the party fought Gazz'uz, was only one of multiple bases for gauging interest (the uninterested were sacrificed for rituals). The Searing Blade is planning to open multiple portals around Orgrimmar in the shape of a crescent moon and need more support to do so
- Jes'rimon tells the party that due to the North Watch incursion on Duratar, the Shattered Hand's resources are spread too thin to investigate this threat. He asks that they investigate on his behalf, and do what they can to clear out Ragefire. He will award them 10 GP/cultist
- The group ask for potions and Jes'rimon says that while he can't give them any for free, Yelmak will give a discount. (we forget this immediately and do not buy potions before going into Ragefire)

- Pushing further towards Ragefire, the group begin to notice holes in the cave walls which seem to be dug out. There are claw marks in and around these holes, but Lu'va's investigation does not reveal much.
- The party find themselves at a shear cliff face, with a frayed rope descending down into the darkness. They tie together their own ropes to descend down and Alyrin goes first, making a commotion by shouting to the party
- Trogs emerge from the holes and begin to attack. Alyrin falls 100 ft and is knocked unconscious. Ga'an descends to try and rescue her but is also knocked off the rope and falls to the ground unconscious. He fails his death saves and dies, yikes
- The noise is loud enough to summon an Earth Elemental which first attacks the trogs, allowing Isilee to safely descend and heal Alyrin.
- Ga'an is reanimated, seemingly by his shadow. We don't have time to unpack all of that...
- Adelaide and Juniper make it down safely, in time to help fight the Earth Elemental

- Isilee pours a vial of Orc blood she had collected onto the handprint causing a pulse to reverberate through the chamber, revealing a doorway
- The party pass a large stone statue and find an extinguished campfire and a hut with a collapsed roof. Ga'an begins to summon a shadow, which makes his tattoos glow

# Session #18
# Full Notes
- The session began with Adelaide arguing for the group to return to Orgrimmar now that Uto had been found.
- The party persuades her to stay and push onwards because they'll all totally be super fine
- Conversing with the Orc prisoners reveals that the names Taragamon and Jergosh have come up in discussions between guards-- they are probably running this operation
Uto mentions that he is a veteran of the First War. The party lies that they've moved into his house while he was gone
- Ga'an continues to be evasive about his new powers and everything that has occurred since his alleged death. When asked about Bwonsamdi, he explains that he is the loa of the dead, and therefore is a good deity to have the favor of given the killing and death surrounding the party
- The party brainstorm codewords for battle strategies, which are: Despacito - bladesong; Hasslehoff - buff; Scatter - scatter; Merry-go-round - everyone go into Melee
- The party heads deeper into Ragefire and find mummified corpses on a bridge. They identify one body, to be Urkar Firefist, the young shaman that Kardris Dreamseeker told them had disappeared. Clutched in his fist, they find his totem
- A booming voice echoes around the chasm - Taragamon the Hungerer: “Mighty heroes of the Horde, welcome to Ragefire Chasm! I've been expecting you.”
- The party rushes forward to confront Taragamon, and Adelaide is almost immediately yeeted into the lava, where she misses the insta-death threshold by one point of damage
- The party miraculously prevails without any deaths today, yay
Pouring lava descends on the party, who all start to run before Isilee identifies that it is an illusion and confronts the hiding cultist who conjured it
- The cultist states that Bazzalan will get here soon and Taragamon was just a figurehead meant to distract them. Isi kills him after acquiring this information.
- The party find an "office" further into the cave system with a grimoire on the table initialed "N.F.". They can hear cultists chanting not too far away
- Adelaide notices that Taragamon's blade, which glows in the presence of Fel magic, glows a bit brighter when near Isilee. She asks Isilee to cast a cantrip for her and remarks that it's interesting but won't clarify further.
- The party double back to the last camp they cleared, dump the orc bodies in lava, and set up for a long rest

- Isilee tries very hard to make friends with Ga'an and Adelaide. Neither conversation goes particularly well, but Ga'an opens up slightly about who his parents were and why the Echo Isles are important to him. Adelaide mentions that she was once close to someone named Mina, but they haven't spoken in a very long time.
- The GayteKeepërs inspects a grimoire initialed "N.F": it is an extensive journal primarily written in Eradun. It seems to be a research journal
- The party encounter Bazzalan the Satyr and stop a group of warlocks from summoning another Fel Guard just in the nick of time. Many souveniers are taken from Bazzalan's corpse. Some are consumed.
- Isilee mentions missing her fiancé Pietro, and their murder-cuddles

- The GayteKeepërs make their way to Yelmak's Alchemy, where they sell the basilisk parts they harvested and go to meet with Jes'rimon.
- The party is introduced to our brother, our captain, our king, Whuut
- Jes'rimon is surprised to see the party alive (same) and is at first skeptical of their claims that Neeru was collaborating with the Searing Blade. He compares the handwriting of the documents the party found to the translation of the Eradun missive Neeru previously gave the party and does find them to be comparable
- Jes'rimon recognizes several names on the list of "Eyes and Ears in Orgrimmar". One is Kartosh Soulflame, a well-respected Shaman in the Valley of Wisdom. Another familiar name is Nekros Clantaker, a gang leader in the Cleft of Shadows.
- After meeting with Jes'rimon, the party run some quick errands on the way to the Broken Tusk Tavern, where they promptly get hammered on Tauren Kodo Sweat (this drink is chosen in particular in honor of the Tauren Winter Veil festival which occurred while the party was in Ragefire Chasm.
- The party attempt to sleep off their drinks but are attacked in the middle of the night by assassins, who they mostly wipe the floor with (but one gets away >:( )

- The Gaytekeepërs are woken by a knock on the door of their shared room -- two orc guards who identify themselves as Mojka and Komak.
- The guards report that the intruders from the night before were members of the Clantaker gang. This is concerning as the gang is not typically known to venture far from the Cleft of Shadows, particularly not to the Valley of Strength where the embassy is located.
- The party convinces the guards that they are unfamiliar with the Cleft of Shadows, and that they were likely attacked due to being drunk and having come into money from cashing in on a contract with Yelmak
- The party head downstairs to breakfast. An Orc bumps into Isilee, who looks down to discover a note with the Shattered Hand logo that simply reads "URGENT"
- Juniper casts Pass Without a Trace on the party, who all make their way to Yelmak's Alchemy as stealthily as they can.
The door is locked when they arrive and upon knocking, a voice yells that they're closed. Jes'rimon recognizes the party and tells Yelmak to let them in.
- Yelmak's store is in disarray, appearing to be ransacked, the floor littered with shattered bottles and books fallen from shelves
- Yelmak himself is visibly injured, as is Jes'rimon. Jes'rimon explains that the store was attacked during the night by three orcs who tried to break into Jes'rimon's office. The body of one, dispatched by Jes'rimon, lies on the ground with a gash across his neck. The other two, one male and one female, escaped (but the female was slashed across the eye)

- A plan emerges: confront Neeru directly, with Jes’rimon providing backup, to gauge his reaction.
- Juniper and Isilee stock up on supplies at the inscription store so Adelaide can make a copy of the grimoire.
- Alyrin dives into arts and crafts—learning to emboss—and it goes flawlessly. Everyone agrees it’s perfect.
- Jes’rimon (repeatedly) reminds the group: we are NOT giving Neeru the copy, just showing him we have it.
- The team heads to the Cleft of Shadows to execute the plan but spots two guards on worgs leaving the cleft—one of them is Harkzog.
- The group hides in an alley while Jes’rimon and Isilee (with pika Lu’va) stake out the Darkfire Enclave tent.
- The tent is shuttered, with two orcs inside. Isilee overhears them discussing that someone attacked Neeru earlier that day. She and Jes return to report back.
- Isilee and Alyrin head back, release pika Lu’va, and use the distraction to investigate. Alyrin charms one of the orcs while Isilee and Lu’va keep them busy.
- They learn that Neeru was attacked by an orc woman with a facial scar, whom he killed; he was only lightly injured. The guards don’t know where Neeru lives. Isilee may or may not have promised to bring him cactus apple bread.
- On their way out, Isilee and Alyrin spot a spy in an alley. They manage to take him down non-lethally and dose him with truth serum.
- The group interrogates him—Alyrin’s finger obsession makes a reappearance—and learns:
- The spy’s name is Marcog, and he works for Nekros.
- No one actually attacked Neeru.
- Neeru summoned Nethraza Doomrend, a laborer in the Drag and Eyes-and-Ears target, then killed her with green fire.
- Neeru operates out of a tunnel off Shadow Swift Underground, and Marcog gives directions.
- Jes’rimon assigns the next task: take out Nekros and Harkzog. (Late-night assassin fun time!)

- The GayteKeepërs head towards the Shadowswift Brotherhood to find Nekros and hopefully bring him in for questioning
- Upon reaching the alcove where Nekros has made his hideout, Isilee sets off a trap which explodes, knocking Adelaide unconscious
- Pushing further in, another trap is set off (this time a swinging log) which hits Isi.
- Ga'an is investigating a table in the room when he is stabbed from behind and drops unconsious
- A battle ensues wherein the party are able to subdue Nekros (via Ga'an's sleep spell). They tie him up. disarm him, and feed him Isi's truth serum potion
- Nekros is initially reluctant to part with any information, and is unfazed by the removal of his finger during the interrogation
Eventually, the Gaytekeepërs are able to convince him that Thrall will grant mercy and is his best shot at living
- Nekros relents and spills the beans, confirming the attack on Neeru to be a false flag and sharing that their new goal was to clean up lose ends in their network, with the next target being Harkzog. Kartosh was potentially going to be kept alive as he was still useful for bringing in young shaman eager to prove themselves
- Nekros allied with Neeru due to the promise of power with the Burning Legion's return
- Neeru and Nekros were going to meet in the early morning at the Darkfire Enclave to discuss next steps
- The party knock Nekros out one more time and stuff him into an empty barrel so they can carry him through the Cleft of Shadows without suspicion. While searching his hideout, they also find a ledger containing the operations of the Clantakers
- The Gaytekeepërs travel back to Yelmak's Alchemy, dropping the barrel once but otherwise successfully carrying it to their destination. Upon showing their prize to Jes'rimon, they find that Nekros has died during the journey (due to the blood loss from his missing finger)
- The party fill Jes'rimon in on what occurred, and agree that their next course of action should be to stakeout Harkzog and hopefully capture him alive.

- The GayteKeepërs attempt to travel stealthily to the Valley of Honor to reach the Hall of the Brave where they hope to find and interrogate Harkzog
- The party splits up into two groups to locate Harkzog
Isilee eventually spots Harkzog going into a building and signals through Lu'va for the others to catch up to her
- Ga'an notices multiple sources of deep, heavy, animalistic breathing: Harkzog is currently in the Worg stables, tacking up one of the many Worgs
- Isi is a bit too enthusiastic in her sneak attack and one hit-KOs Harkzog. Luckily, he's only mostly dead and Alyrin is able to bring him back from the brink.
- The party notices that Alryin looks a bit more gray than usual and she is struggling to cast Holy magic
- The Worgs begin to stir and make a commotion, causing the party to quickly flee with Harkzog in tow as a group of guards come around the corner
- The guards are able to track the group with the help of the Worgs, so Adelaide and Isi split off from the group to try and make a diversion
- Adelaide assumes the form of a young troll, telling the guards that her name is "Ba'an" and that she is lost. This doesn't go as well as planned and the two end up fleeing, accumulating several points of exhaustion and finally finding refuge in an engineering shop, careful to avoid the many deadly traps. The guards have much less luck and are nearly killed by a giant metal piston spike, causing them to abandon their chase
- Meanwhile, Ga'an, Alryin, and Juniper have their own shenanigans attempting to find a cart for Harkzog's body, but manage to make it back to Yelmak's Alchemy's...just to realize they've been tracked there by the Worgs
- Jes'rimon is forced to use his status as a member of the Shattered Hand to turn the guards away, compromising the secrecy of his base of operations. He is very, very pissed about this
- An interrogation of Harkzog ensues, where he reveals that he was trying to defect from the Searing Blade as he only joined to help restore the Horde (more specifically, orcs), return to its former glory
- After learning of Nethraza Doomrend's fate, he finally had enough and wanted to leave before Neeru Fireblade or Nekros Clantaker killed him

- Ga'an has a vision quest and is told by Bwonsamdi to travel to First Home, as is the traditional rite of passage for witch doctors. The catch: First Home is part of the Darkspear isles, which were sunk under water by a sea witch when Ga'an was 10 (he's now 17).
- Ga'an also learns the Bwonsamdi was not always a Loa. The original loa of death was Mueh'zala, who liked the tip the scales in favor of life.
The Sandfury Tribe still worship Mueh'zala and make sacrifices to him. Bwonsamdi would like Ga'an to kill their Chief, Ukorz Sanscalp.
- The party reconvenes at the tavern, and Ga'an recounts the events of his vision as well as his plan to find sailors in his hometown to guide him to where Darkspear once was

- The session begins at the tavern, with Emissary Blackhoof arriving to speak with the GayteKeepërs about the Cenarian Circle
- Blackhoof tells the party of troubling instances of Night Elves not awakening from the Emerald Dream. The druids are unsure of the nature of the issue, especially as their leader, Malfurion Stormrage, has also fallen victim to this.
- Fandral Staghelm has become the interim leader of the Circle in Malfurion's absence. He does not wish for non-druids or undead to enter Moonglade, but Blackhoof gives the Gaytekeepërs a letter requesting that they be given access.
- Moonglade is located near Mount Hyjal, and can be accessed via the Goblin city Everlook
- The party receives a letter from Jes'rimon thanking them for their help, and promising to be in touch shortly about a reward.

- The Gaytekeepers left for the Valley of Wisdom to Thrall’s building, Grommash Hold.
- The corpse of Mannoroth, a demon, is being braced against a giant spike at the entrance of Grommash Hold. A plaque reads: “A testament to the sins of the orcish people, may Grommash’s sacrifice free us of our shackles once and for all.”
- Mannoroth was a Pitlord who enslaved the orcs. Grommash was the first to partake in the gift and the last to finish him off.
- Orc guards line the canyon. Many have black armor with gold detailing, all of which is much more intricate than the armor worn by city guards.
- Several orcs have larger pauldrons and armor with more detailed and decorative armor.
- When the party (minus Adelaide) arrives into the Hold, Kardris Dreamseeker waits for them. The party gives Urcar Firefirst’s totem to Kardris. She thanks them and returns the totem to the Gaytekeepers.
- Eitrigg is Thrall’s advisor. He’s an orc guard with a massive pauldron on one shoulder, likely depicting his rank. He leads the party (minus Adelaide) through hallways until they arrive at a large circular room that has multiple arches and rises to it. There are roughly 12 guards on the edges of the room.
- There are numerous banners hung around the room; one depicts a white wolf face, another, a skull on a red banner. The iconography is detailed and interesting.
- Thrall is a deep emerald green skinned orc with incredibly ornate black and gold armor. He is reading a document when the party arrives; a pike with the head of Neeru Fireblade is at his side.
- Thrall welcomes the party as friends. He’s filled with hope, considering the party to be a representation of the new Horde. He emphasizes this while looking at the elves.
- The party is gifted an orb that will allow Adelaide to find her way back to the party. Ga’an takes the orb.
They then go into the feast, which is filled with breads, smoked meats, and other delicacies.
- Chieftain Vol’jin is a blue troll with traditional tribal paint on his face. He is of the Darkspear trolls. Kardris also enters the room, as does the rest of the elder council.
- Sagorne is a shaman.
- Mokvar and the troll woman seem like lightweights.
- Gotura Fourwinds, a Tauren shaman and ambassador from the Earthen Ring, commented that "the elements are still shy".

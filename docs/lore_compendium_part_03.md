# Full Notes
- The session begins with the party deciding to duck into an alleyway of the Mur’gul slums
- Adelaide is unsure of what the creature from last session was, but finds it reminiscent of dreams they’ve had of late
- Juniper casts Pass Without a Trace on the party
- The group is heading south east towards the ruins of Alme Nalore
- Adelaide casts Major Image to create the distraction of a Kraken going in a north west direction. The Naga spot it and blow their horns to sound the alarm.
- Isilee ducks into a hut and finds it to be occupied. She easily murders it as the rest of the party follows her inside. While Adelaide is passing through the threshold, a Mur’gul spots her and begins to yell. She dispatches it and Alyrin shoves the body into the hut.
- The party continues to move through the slums. Isi peeks into another hut, casting mute on one of the Mur’guls inside. She, Juniper, and Adelaide kill the two Mur’guls while Ga’an and Alyrin investigate an empty hut with a chest.
  - The chest holds several fish, an iridescent conch shell (which Ga’an takes), 3 GP, 2 SP
- Isi checks out another hut that is in a state of disrepair. She notices out of the corner of her eye a reddish Mur’gul with a glowing crystal staff, looking up at the Kraken illusion. Isilee casts Mute on the Mur’gul. The muted Mur’gul attempts to convey the threat to another Mur’gul, who is confused by apparent miming.
- Isilee notices a stone ziggurat with a statue on top with snake-like features. A mur’gul bows down at the altar
- Rotting corpses of adventures decorate the shrine of Zharjira as offerings
- The slums situation escalates as the illusion flickers out. More and more Mur’guls come to investigate the noise, and several Naga catch up as well as a crab/centaur creature.
- With the party low on health and mana, Adelaide grabs a barely conscious Alyrin and Dimension Doors to the edge of the slums.
- Adelaide takes out her sending stone to alert A’thian that the party is out of First Home and making their way back to the ship.
- A’thian is surprised to hear they are alive and informs them that they’ve been gone from the ship for 13 days. His message cuts off as he says, “The captain wants to-”
- Adelaide begins to cast Tiny Hut and sends Lu’va out to catch the attention of the rest of the party.
- Alyrin, unsure of what else to do, takes out the fish she grabbed from the Mur’gul chest and begins to snack.
- The rest of the party just barely manage to make it out of the slums alive, reconvening at the Tiny Hut.

- A creature swims near, long with a rounded front body, fish tail, three long tentacles and a giant, toothy maw. It appears to be an aberration, not of this plan of existence. It has three black eyes aligned vertically.
  - The creature's form shimmers and then splits into two. One goes north, while the other goes south, passing over the Tiny Hut but luckily not stopping.
- Adelaide yells at Ga’an for vetoing the rest of the group about riding the sharks.
- Isilee looks for alignment on how much to give Stormfang as his bonus
- Ga’an proposes going around and back to the ship by going east through the ruins and hugging the shelf
- Stealthing along, Alyrin hears distant moaning/wailing noises in the background, but they ignore the party.
- Two sixty foot statues of night elven figures mark the entrance to the armory
- Adelaide doesnt think its wise to go in, but Isi and Alyrin would like to. The party takes a vote. Isi, Alyrin, and Juniper want to go in which is a majority
- Inside, the structure is half crumbled, similar to the academy that Adelaide explored. On the wall, Isi recognizes the ancient high elf symbol and old darnassian (the sentinels prayer):
  - Through her light we are protected
  - [Larger blank] embrace
  - In her wrath [blank] strengthened
  - Our foes we erase
  - [Blank] death
  - Wax and wane
  - [Larger blank] we are reborn
  - Elune be with us
- Isi & Juniper find one quiver full of 20 wooden arrows, seemingly untouched, and another quiver untouched, beautiful elven design. Alyrin finds one long metal rod carved with runes, uncorroded, and two sealed ceramic jars. Ga’an notices an orb of light, a will o’ wisp traveling around, that hasn't clocked the party.
- Naga seem to avoid the ruins, though the large fish squid like creature seemed to not mind it
- Lot of purple lights floating above the party, seems like patrols have doubled
- Isi suggests looking through the academy again, but Adelaide is not in favor, the group agrees
- The party makes it back to the ship, and Adelaide casts identify on the armory loot:
  - immovable rod
  - Bundle +1 arrows, they stack with +1 bow
  - Quiver is the Quiver of Eonar, the lifebinder, nature goddess, ordering of Azeroth, titan pantheon more associated with dwarven/gnomish religion
  - Bag of holding for ammo
- Turning quiver inside out:
  - Gallons of seawater, oops
  - 40 arrows
  - One extra special arrow with green glow, gnarly tip
- The gem that Adelaide feared is an elemental mote of arcane which can summon an elemental
- Isilee makes a weird souvenir jar of teeth, sand, sea water, booze, eyeballs, fishbones as a “gift” for ga’an
- Ga’an puts on naga priestess robe with two extra arm holes
- The party travels back to Orgrimmar, nightmare free. Ga'an decides to bring the cursed Axe of Shirvalla to the Valley of Spirits.
- The team's plan is to go talk to Jes'rimmon first, then Thrall. They need to run errands in Orgrimmar, then head out to Moonglade by way of Thunderbluff
- The party is surprised by a large guard presence at the dock, and the presence of many warships. They make inquires and discover that the Horde is at war with the Alliance! There is bad fighting in Ashenvale, where the night elves are
- The party recalls that the Forsaken joined the Horde thanks to the help of the Tauren. The Forsaken were attacked by the Eastern Kingdoms, and sent emissaries seeking aide. The only emissaries they sent who weren't killed were the emissaries of the Tauren. The Tauren convinced Thrall to let them join the Horde with the logic that it would give the Horde a foothold in the Eastern Kingdoms
- As the party makes their way to the gates of Orgrimmar, they see a sea of tents: a war camp.

- The party sees thousands upon thousands of soldiers gathered at the gates of Orgrimmar. The amassing army is comprised of orcs, trolls, blood elves, goblins, and taurens. The Blood elves are few and far between, and have very posh tents. There are catapults, metal humanoid contraptions with sawblade and three finger claw arms.
- Inside the gates is a celebratory atmosphere. It is still the Feast of Wintervale, though it is the last day. There are festival goers with fluffy white hats, and sea of colored clothing. The whole valley smells of spices and baked goods.
- A small older goblin man with puffed out hair and sideburns dressed in heavy furs advertises his cart of wacky eccentricities. The party immediately b-lines for this and buys from him celebones, an oops stone, and an invisibility ring (single use).
- The desert is pretty cold this time of year, around 35 degrees
- The gang bullies a small goblin child trying to make a living on the shell game, and then Isi wins Addie a candied apple <3
- Addie cheats on the hammer game but it's fine.
- Alyrin sits on Mall Santa's lap and gets a sketch of it. She leaves a nice tip for the poor overworked artist while the rest of the gang get food and Adelaide gets a dreidel.
- In a game of archery, Isilee wins two rats that she names A’thian and Ga’an. Juniper wins dolls to send to her parents, while Adelaide gets a Sylvanas doll and reminsices about childhood dreams of becoming a Farstrider.
- The party meet Teja, a troll from the mercenary group calling themselves the Gutter Rats. She informs the party of a grand tournament taking place in the Hall of the Brave. She fills the party in that the war began with the disappearnce of the human king Varian Wryne, which the Alliance blamed on the Horde.
- The Gutter Rats have been working out of the crossroads escorting caravans for the war effort. They've mostly contended with centaur and quillboar raiding parties.
- The Gaytekeepërs make their way to the Hall of the Brave and find they've missed the registration period. They name drop Madam Marem to get themselves on the list last minute. They are ushered inside where they meet a very self-important Orc man with a golden tusk.
- Isilee spies on a meeting where she overhears that Warsong Lumber Camp has fallen due to the "damn night elves" and others of the alliance. Lady Proudmoore (assumably Jaina and not her mother) has requested to meet with the Warchief.
- The Gaytekeepërs are brought into the prep room. There, they see the other groups of adventures including the Gutter Rats, as well as two young shaman.
- The party discusses strategy and collaboration, particularly about focusing on one target at a time.
- The tournament begins acknowledging the esteemed leadership present at the event, including Thrall, the high shaman of the Horde, and "regent lord of Quel'thalas, Lor'themar Theron". He is a Blood Elf with one blazing emerald green eye. The other eye has a long dark scar passing through it.
- This announcement is news to Isilee and Adelaide that Kael'thas is no longer the leader of the Blood Elves. Adelaide knows of Lor'themar, having met him in passing on several occasions while attending dinners with her father. He was once a Farstrider, second in command to Sylvannas.
- The tournament is held in a round pit, with an iron cage to protect the crowd. The Gaytekeepërs battle their way through three fights and emerge victorious alongside the Gutter Rats. The Horde leaders all make their way to congratulate the winners. Lor'themar says "very impressive" to the group, but nothing else. He looks over them, and his eye twitches in a second of recognition when he sees Adelaide. He leaves with Thrall and Farseer.

- The party retires to the Broken Tusk Tavern to celebrate their victory.
- Isilee convinces Morag to give them the room for free, as a discount for the fact that they were attacked viciously in the night the last time that they stayed there.
- While the group is feasting on raptor meats and pumpkin spice waffles, Isilee and Alyrin notice some orcs in the corner watching them surreptitiously.
- Isilee volunteers to go check it out, and goes over to the orcs. They immediately try but fail to spell her, suggesting she go to room 4 of Dark Earth tavern as they had some business with her they wanted to take care of.
- Isilee returns to the table and alerts the rest of the party to this problem. A plan is conceived where Isilee will set out without the rest of the party, who will sneak down to the Cleft of Shadows and follow her invisibly behind. Isi will take Lu'va with her so Adelaide can see where she is.
- This plan is enacted, and Isi leaves for the cleft. The rest of the party finishes their food and then heads after her.
- Upon Isi's arrival at the tavern, she attempts to interact with a whittling troll that does not want to talk to her. She rents a room up front with the owner, and inquires about the orcs that told her to come there, but is met with resistance as this would be a breach of privacy. She heads back to the room, where she is greeted by rat dung and another spell, which compels her to allow herself to be tied up by some elves that enter the room after her. Lu'va is dispelled.
- Isilee is interrogated by her former boss, Cinder Sharpflyer, about her business with Ravenhold and the Syndicate.
- It is revealed that Cinder received a burn notice from Isilee's fiancé Pietro, detailing her double-cross and alleging that she spied on the Syndicate and was working against Blades of the Sun.
- Isilee defended herself, claiming that she never worked against Blades of the Sun, but did spy on the Syndicate without being told to by Cinder, and further did not contact him after running away.
- The rest of the party sneaks to the Cleft, where they pause to wait as Alyrin makes them invisible. She does, and Adelaide attempts to use the ring of invisibility that she purchased from the cart merchant in the last session. Much to the party's chagrin, the ring turns invisible, and nothing else happens. Adelaide resolves to use her Lu'vavision to work out where Isilee is being held. Alyrin and Juniper go forward toward the tavern, while Ga'an and Adelaide stay behind.
- Alyrin is unable to open the door, as it has been locked since after Isilee arrived. She attempts to use the magic key she obtained before, but it does not work. She then uses one of the patches off the robe of useful items and installs a new iron door like two feet away from the other door, and enters invisibly through that. This scares and inspires the tavern keeper.
- Adelaide attempts to connect to Lu'va but finds that she has difficulty doing so. She begins to blindly walk toward the tavern to see if she can get within range (not knowing if Lu'va has been dispelled or not). She is unable to connect, and Dimension Doors herself and Ga'an into the tavern successfully. However, the second that she arrives, she is attacked by none other than Kanyi, a troll she worked with on her side adventure with Jes'rimon.
- Kanyi immediately heals Adelaide and chastises her for coming. She then tells her that if any other members of the party are there to reveal themselves.
- At this point, Ga'an, Alyrin, and Juniper all break invisibility, and Kanyi is like. Okay. Sure, I guess
- The group is lead to where Isi is being held. Cinder has them all drink truth serum after Juniper reminds him that he has it.
- The truth serum 'tastes like blue'
- Isilee tells Cinder she saw him as more of a creepy uncle than a dad
- Under the truth serum's influence, Isi confirms her earlier stances to Cinder, who accepts them as truth.
- Cinder asks if there is anything else he should know about, and Isi and Adelaide take the chance to tell him about the goings-on related to the Old gods and their discoveries of that nature from the First Home adventure.
- Cinder releases the party and says that he will relay their findings to Thrall.
- Isilee later reveals to the party that she did not work against Blades of the Sun, but rather wanted to leave the organization.
- The group returned to their room and split the winnings of the competition earlier before turning in for the night.
- The next day, the party engaged in rapid shopping, before Ga'an went to meet with the shamans in the Valley of Spirits to bring them the Axe of Shirvallah and discuss with them the events that went on at First Home.

- Adelaide leads Isilee, Alyrin, and Juniper to Coifcurl Spa in the Valley of Wisdom.
- The spa offers many treatments, including mud baths, massages, and shamman IBS treatment.
- The girls treat themselves and emerge clean, shiny, and with killer hair
- Isilee tries to dip her rats in mud and one (Ga’an) bites her and escapes. She mentions this to the owner, who is definitely going to fire an innocent employee now.
- During the mud bath, Adelaide confides in the others about the secrecy of bladesinging and her theft of a bladesinger textbook when she wasn’t selected for the program
- Everyone agrees it’s probably fine and won’t come back to bite us in the tooshie.
- Part two of Girls Day™ is clothing shopping at Magar’s Cloth Goods! Isi negotiates the price down for a sponsorship contract.
- The tailor, Magar Irontusk, doesn’t like logos, thinks it's tacky (fair). The party will advertise through word of mouth instead.
- The girls pay half now, half later (40 now, 40 later)
- The party meets up with Ga’an who has been waiting outside the Cleft of Shadows since speaking to the witchdoctors
- While waiting, Ga’an overhears guards discussing an escort job to the Crossroads. The job involves fighting quillboars and pays pretty well. It is sponsored by the military
- The Gaytekeepers stop in at Madam Maram’s, who is pleased by the publicity the party has stirred up for her. Her stock is low because of the conflict (and popularity spurred by the Gaytekeepers)
- Adelaide inquires about items which allow for more prepared spells. Maram did have a ring of spell storage, which was bought by a blood elven woman.
- This woman turns out to be one of the elves involved in Isi’s kidnapping, Satashia
- Maram offers the party a job: she has beef with another magic shop owner who one upped her with an acquisition.
- The item is a ring with a blue gem, though Maram would not say its purpose
- The ring was bought (before Maram could acquire it) by Enchanter Farendin Manaflame at Godan’s Runeworks
- Farendin is a recent arrival from Silvermoon and fails to recognize the way things are done in Orgrimmar
- Godan has felt empowered by him, and Farendin needs to be put in his place
- The party negotiates a price of 1500 gp + 1 alchemist fire + 1 spice pouch
- Payment is contingent upon the job going smoothly (i.e., the theft can’t be linked back to her)
- If the ring is obtained in this scenario, the party must still provide it to Maram
- If the ring is not provided to Maram, the party will not be able to set foot in Orgrimmar again (on threat of death)
- Maram gives the Gaytekeepers one week to think on the job and perform any reconnaissance, after that, the job will be given to another party.
- Back at the inn, many plans are thrown around, including polymorphing Farendin into a worm and Isilee distracting him in disguise as a suitor.
- Ga’an and Isilee also speak briefly about being chosen of the loa
- Adelaide shows the rest of the party the puzzle ball, and tries to identify it (unsuccessfully)
- Ga’an inspects it, noting the polished platinum with rings of gold filigree, impossibly small and intricate engravings, and a faint purplish-blue glow through one of the grooves
- The button to create coins jams, though more pieces of the puzzle present themselves
- Adelaide progresses the puzzle until a new button is revealed.
- The new button creates 7 garnets, 3 corals, and 1 jade before it jams.
- Alyrin tries to remove curse, nothing happens
- Isilee is concerned for Adelaide’s safety, believing the puzzle ball to be dangerous, but Addie says she has it under control.
- The next morning, Isilee goes in disguise as a blood elf soldier to seduce Farendin
- Isi stealthily throws A’thian the rat under the back curtain in Godan’s shop, then yells after the rat and chases him through the curtain.
- A blood elven man in green robes has cast hold on the rat, and asks Isi to take it and leave
- Isi unsuccessfully tries to flirt first with Farendin, then with Godan. She learns that Farendin is happily married and lives with his wife, and is asked to leave the store.
- She then tries to ask about “Stacy Manaflame” at Yelmak’s but is met with confused looks.
- Whuut now has glasses to correct his colorblindness, good for him.
- Meanwhile, Alyrin and Adelaide go to the gem store and have several gems identified.
- Alyrin once again moonlight calms one of the elf twins, though it is unclear which.
- Back at the inn, Adelaide progresses the puzzle further and finds a knob which creates a two foot wide black hole in the ground.
- Some investigation reveals it is a portal to a pocket room with a pile of magical items
- One ladder patch and several shenanigans later, Isi emerges with several items of non-magical clothes(a fur coat embroidered with the letter “E” and boots), a wizard’s staff, and a rod of hand-warming
- More of the puzzle has opened up now, and the purple-blue glow can be seen clearly through large cracks in the mechanism.

- The session begins with the party debating the pros and cons of the heist. Isi, Ga'an, and Alyrin plan to scout the shop and invisibly trail Farendin back to his home so Ga'an can cast Locate Object.
- The shop (Godan’s Rune Works) is built against cliff edge so there is no back entrance. Isi instead tries to sneakily look in window, and Ga'an decides to mention after already reaching the shop that he doesn't have Locate Object prepared.
- Farendin notices Alyrin and Isi in the alley and calls for guards when he sees them turn invisible. The guard's response is quick, as the guard post is right next to Godan's. Farendin casts Detect Magic and points to where Isi and Alyrin are standing.
- Alyrin rolls a nat 20 to stealth away but Isi has no such luck. She drops invisibility and lies that their suspicious activity was them trying to conceal their affair, a ploy that somehow succeeds. Farendin warns her that he should never see her again, before portalling away.
- Isi and Alyrin eventually make their way back to the tavern and fill the group in on what happened. The party takes some shots and Ga'an dares Adelaide to keep exploring the puzzle ball. This results in the whole party being sucked into the ball, finding themselves in a dimly lit pentagonal room with marble flooring. Around the room are five pillars on a raised decagon dias, which the party landed on.
- There are five banners draping down to the floor from about 12ft up. Their colors are blue, black, green, red, and orange-green. A stylized elvish E is stylized in gold thread on the banner. Two figures additional figures are in the room, mummified Night Elf corpses. One is standing while the other lies on the floor.
- Detect magic reveals the room to be "oozing" conjuration, and all the banners are magical.
- Emblazoned on chest is symbol of eye
- The standing figure appears to have been magically aged to the point of death. The prone figure has been petrified.
- Behind green banner is a statue of tree like figure (Tree Ent) with mouth agape and green gems for eyes. It is lifelike though it is made from stone. A poisonous fog releases from its mouth as soon as the banner is lifted.
- Adelaide casts tiny hut while the others investigate the room. Ga'an conjures Chadow to have him lift banners. The red shoots flame, the blue causes cold damage but conceals a door. Ga'an casts Dispel Magic and Alyrin uses her magical key to unlock the door.
- The party hold hands as they walk through the door, and notice the eye sigil start to reglow as they leave.
- The door leads to a narrow hallway in a slanted tunnel. The path feels spiral. It eventually opens into a marble chamber, 70 ft tall and filled with books, cabinets, and a massive stained glass window. Everything in the room is of elven design.
- A map of the planes hangs on the wall. Directly across is a doorway made of Atwood. The door is shut and has a large glowing yellow gem
- The spine of each book is blank. A metal clasp on each book keeps its position. A few books are clearly missing from the shelves. Each book is locked in place.
- The party spots a beautiful purple leather tomb with gold and sapphires laid upon the spine
- On the table is a coffee cup which is cold, but not moldy. A book on table is covered in similar silver clasp. A golden globe shows the world as all ocean with just one continent.
- Juniper inspects stained glass, finds small glowing purple gem (amethyst) in the middle. As Juniper takes it out, there is a shattering noise and juniper is gone. One blank picture now has image of arcane academy that we saw underwater.
- The other blank picture coalesces into older night elven man with purple skin, black robes with silver trim, silver hair with beard and pointed eyebrows. His eyes are a burning purplish magenta. Dark purple tattoos on his face, a gem on his forehead. A solid silver necklace seems to levitate an inch off his shoulders.
- Adelaide touches the gem Juniper vanished in front of to identify, is sucked in. Isi, then Alyrin and Ga'an follow.
- Cut to Juniper, falling through a wormhole. She lands in a chamber full of bone fragments. The chamber splits into 5 passage ways, one with dead end and an orb.
- A large reptilian head rests atop a heap of treasure. The dragon lifts its head and questions Juniper. He says the "Edel has not returned in ages" and that he hungers. He attacks and Juniper holds her own until the rest of the party arrives. Adelaide polymorphs the Wyrm into a Worm, and shoves him into the bag of holding. This succeeds in killing him, with the unfortunate side effect of destroying the bag of holding and releasing all the contents into the astral plane.

- The session begins with the party examining their surroundings in the dragon's room. There are five statues of dragons clutching giant gems. Two dragons have glowing eyes (one orange, one black).
- At the other end of the room is an alter. On it is a raised pillar holding an orb with five fingers.
- Also around the room are vast quantities of gold, jewelry, and various magical items which the group distributes amongst themselves. Alyrin takes the armor of acid resistance(?) and the cloak of displacement. Juniper takes the ring of fire resistance. Adelaide takes the amulet of health. Isi (?) takes the wand of web.
- Isilee is able to unlock one of the books taken from the study. Alyrin is able to read it as it is written in Darnassian. The book contains public debate records from the Forum of Almenalor in the year 1044 of the Highborne Dynasty. It discusses the ethics of arcane experimentation on troll prisoners and warnings of enraging the wild god spirits they pray to. The book contains transcripts of multiple days of debates about Zuldara trolls, the breaking of the Zandalari Empire and how trolls are useful for arcane research. It also theorizes on the origination of Loa and ways of harnessing them.
- After an embarrassing amount of time, the party realizes the five statues need to be made to glow the five colors of the dragon flight with spells representing the five domains. This activates the orb, which the party all touch at the same time, landing them in Madam Marum's tent.

- The party has crash landed on the floor of Marum's tent. They spot a table on a pedestal, holding up the puzzle sphere. Marum and her assistant, a light blue skinned troll with fiery red hair (Jaboon) comes into the room and demand to know what's going on.
- Discourse ensures but tldr Marum insists its hers now because someone brought it to her from the Broken Tusk Tavern (the party was in the ball for 12-13 days). The party, but agree to come back during the day time to discuss further. Isi steals a crystal orb on the way out.
- On the way back, there is a noticeably larger guard presence in the cleft of shadows. The party decides to spend the night at Miwanna's Longhouse.
- In the morning, the group drops off gold at the bank before heading to the Broken Tusk. Questioning Morag and her niece goes nowhere.
- Juniper & Alyrin go to the post office while the others go to the flight tower and meet an Orc named Doras who speaks incredibly slowly. The trip will take 1.5-2 days on Wyvern-back. There are enough wyverns if Isi and Adelaide share. It will be 70 GP per wyvern. Airships and waterships are also looked into, but are slower.
- The party stops in at Godan's and buys a haversack of holding. They also place an order for a bag of holding, which will be ready on feb 8th at the earliest. 2000 GP is put down and 2000 GP more will be due on receipt of the item.
- Juniper speaks to Isi's rat and attempts to free him, but Isi rolls a nat 20 to catch him.
- The plan to smooth things over with Marum goes horribly wrong and the group gets stuck in a blood contract with her. Adelaide might need to call in some favors in Silvermoon to break the contract.
- Adelaid gets very very drunk and shares information on how she ran away from school because she was rejected from the bladesingers program. She also mutters the name "Iyllsa".
- Juniper successfully releases Garfunkle the rat on her second try.
- Isi goes to the Spirit Lodge to speak to Alortha No Shadra.
- The next day, the party leaves to fly to Zoram’gar in Ashenvale (which is just south of Felwood). From there it will be a 5 day journey to the firbolg village. The Felwood used to be a lush forest, but was corrupted during the 3rd war.

- The party has flown west across the Southfury River, crossing the savannah.
- Doras rides Fluffy, Isilee and Adelaide share Fuzzy, Juniper rides Bot, Ga'an rides Mittens, and Alyrin is on Slagathor.
- While flying over the Stonetalon Mountains, they notice interruptions in the pine forest. What was once a dense forest with streams and a lake are now peppered with houses and huts. Large plumes of smoke rise from within the basin. Small figures walk throughout, as well as strange contraptions that are humanoid in shape but don't move normally which aid in cutting down the wood.
- The party lands in the woods for the night. They feel similar to first home in the ancient, awing feeling. Alyrin feels that it is familiar yet off. Doras states that the Night Elves keep their distance from this place, which is why this is a relatively safe location to make camp.
- Nearby the landing spot is a darkened lake with a small island at the center. Doras has not personally been but scouted small ruins that he hasn't investigated. Lu'va goes to scout with the help of Juniper's Darkvision spell, but predictably rolls horribly on both stealth and perception.
- There is the noise of something diving into the water, but Lu'va doesn't see the source.
- The island is about 70ft in diameter. All around are the lights of blue orbs hovering a few feet off the ground. These are wisps, but they are not aggressive. The orbs have an almost ethereal face with elven features inside. The spirits of night elves are said to inhibit the woods of Kalimdor. This is where they return after death.
- The foliage on the island is different than the surrounding forest. There seems to be a sickness to the island; the leaves are darkened, younger tress have sprouted out with sickly roots, and the bushes and shrubs have blackened. One exception: clustered flowers of white seem to be unaffected by the other plants' illness.
- Ancient marble columns surround a structure with a Tori Gate-esque roof and dais. In the center of the dais is a cracked bowl filled with putrid water. Inscriptions are carved into the bowl and surrounding stone. Six columns, two of which have collapsed, hold up a ring above. The architecture is definitely Night Elven. The whole gazebo is overgrown with ivy and appears to be incredibly old.
- This structure is known as a Moonwell, and is very important in Night Elven culture. It is a font if magical power and a means by which Elune can bestow power onto the elves. It is used for rituals, religious practices, etc. They are always highly cared for and maintained due to their sacred nature. They are believed to be the spots where Elune's tears touched Kalimdor. Astrenar is a nearby Elven settlement, which should be maintaining this Moonwell.
- When Lu'va returns, the party ask about the constructs they spotted during the day. Doras explains that it was the Venture Company in Windshear Crag, a group of mercenaries. They hire humans, dwarves, black iron dwavers, ogres, orcs, and even gnolls. The party is warned to stay clear of them.
- Isilee convinces Duras to leave later in the day tomorrow so the party can check out the island. The Gaytekeepers go for a night swim to the island. On the island there is a reptilian figure on four legs, a small green dragon. They are sacred and work with Night Elf druids as protectors of the Emerald Dream. This dragon seems to be only a wyrmling (a baby), which would only speak Draconic and cannot really communicate.
- The wyrmling spooks when it spots the party and dives into the water, disappearing under the island. Alyrin jumps in after and follows after. She resurfaces into a cave. Tracks lead deeper into the cave, which Alyrin follows to find two dragons which hiss at her, kicking off initiative.
- Isilee follows after Alyrin, nearly drowning. There are actually four dragons in the cave.
- Meanwhile, the rest of the crew investigate the top of the island. The white flowers are Stardust Flowers and are resilient to the island's sickness. The Moonwell bowl contains transmutation magic. A face comes out of the bowl, attacking Adelaide. Its a Banshee!
- Both groups get their asses handed to them, with Adelaide aging 10 years and the flowers also attacking the party. But they live!
- Alyrin manages to break the curse on several dragons. Their eyes go from black eyes with pulsing veins to a healthy looking yellow. Alyrin offers the wyrmlings a fish as a peace offering.

- In the cavern is a portal showing a realm of green beyond. The wyrmling describes it as “where we came from”. It is inferred to be the Emerald Dream
- Through the portal, Isi and Alryin can see tar-like water and tentacle-like protrusions wrapping around boughs of trees.
- On the trees that the tentacles touch are glowing red shards, and odd growths which are masses of bone, flesh, and teeth. Slits in the growths open up into yellow eyes
- The masses shriek and pull their way towards where the tear is.
- Alyrin is unsuccessful in her attempt to convince the wyrmlings to leave with them. The wyrmlings grow more aggressive and clearly become re-cursed from stepping in the sludge.
- Alyrin and Isi flee, swimming back to the surface to reunite with the rest of the party.
- The gang investigates the moonwell more now that the banshees are gone. The water in the basin is scummy, reminiscent of pond water.
- Around the marble basin is an inscription in ancient elvish “speak her oath whilst her gaze is fully upon thee for only then shall she reveal her gift”. The “oath” refers to the Sentinel Prayer:
Through her light we are protected
Her love we embrace
In her wrath we are strengthened
Our foes we erase
Life and Death
Wax and Wane
Through her gift we are reborn
Elune be with us
- Alyrin says the prayer, but nothing happens. This likely must be done under a full moon.
- The group returns to the camp and requests Doras’ map of ashenvale, which Adelaide is able to duplicate.
- For 125 GP, Doras is willing to stay the extra two days until the full moon arrives.
- Doras will stay here for two days for 125 gold.
- The party’s plan is to try and fix the Moonwell during the full moon, and potentially investigate the Emerald Dream portal if it seems to be cured by the Moonwell’s restoration
- Adelaide and isi have a heart to heart, while on watch. Adelaide explains the situationship she had with Iyllsa and why she was so upset about having to go home.
- In the morning, Ga’an wakes up and finds giant reptilian footprints on the ground that apparently went unnoticed on watch. It appears that a dragon was right outside of the Tiny Hut, unnoticed by Isi and Adelaide.
- We successfully stealth to the edge of the lake, find a group of different footprints
  - Juniper identifies them as 4 sets of dragon tracks leading away from lake. Medium-larger creature.
- Ga’an casts underwater breathing
- Now in the cave, we see a variety of tracks the same size as the ones by the lake front
- Cave seems to echo with the sound of ominous heavy breathing
- Isi steps into the bubbling, blackened sludge
  - It starts to move as isi steps into it
- Heavy deep breathing has changed -- was just aroused by the fighting
  - Its a dragon wyrmling
- We fight and kill all four wyrmlings, RIP
- We enter the goo room and alyrin gets goo’d. She is KO’d and absorbed into goo
- Juniper pulls alyrin’s body out. Alyrin loses two death saves but stabilizes at the start of her turn thanks to the periapt
- Isi one hit KOs the goo but theres more goo coming out of the portal and two dragons back the way we came
- Isi and the shadows take care of the dragons while ga’an manages to close the portal just in time
- Webbing across walls of the room with a slow pulse, not seeming to react to our presence. Isi firebolts it and sears it away. Addie joins her and together they scorch away the unnatural growths
- Each egg is sitting in pools of black webbing ichor
- Two are freshly hatched
- Adelaide melts the web off the egg but the baby dragon is still cursed and in critical condition
  - We stabilize him and short rest
  - As we’re resting, another hatches
  - Isi fails to pretend to be a dragon and gets poisoned

- Retcon of morning:
  - Team discussion on whether to continue on to Zoram Gar
    - Alyrin initially wanted to continue procrastinate going home and wanted to go to Zoram Gar “for intel gathering”
    - Isi makes a joke about things to steal at the outpost
    - The group immediately decides that isi cannot be allowed near a town for the time being and its decided to have Doras go on while we take the road by raynewood retreat (quicker route)
  - Doras is knitting a hat for Fluffy, in Fluffy’s favorite color, beige
    - Juniper makes a flower crown out of late bloomers and moss
- Team swam back to island to debrief
- Alyrin’s bad dream about brother involved emerald dream, there were bad vibes and Elune said things are bad you gotta go help
  - Alyrin also had heard that issues were happening with druids and the dream
- In Night Elf Religion, its thought that when you die, you join Elune as a star. The white flowers (Stardust Blossom) are significant in their association with that as they are believed to be remnants that the ancestors leave behind
  - Very holy, considered to have warding powers against evil
  - Alyrin takes a little bite of one (just a lil bite)
    - Feels something very subtle that she can’t place initially
    - There’s a sweet flavor (something that Alyrin hasn’t really tasted since dying)
    - Tiny bit of a burn after taste, soft but abrasive
- Back at camp, the gang:
  - Ga’an does some alchemy on the flowers, makes a vial of Stardust Essence
  - Isi works on some poisons and then podcasts her thoughts on Tusk Love
  - Alyrin thinks about what will happen to her soul now that she’s a forsaken, will she still be able to join Elune as other night elves do?
  - Adelaide meditates and attunes to the leylines, also contemplating mortality. She senses a well of mana, similar to how the sunwell once felt but a calmer, cooler light. The source of this is to the north-east, but it is not too distant from here (definitely not Silvermoon)
  - Juniper goes hunting (after confirming that its not violating a holy site). She finds a beautiful white deer and prepares to shoot it
    - Hears a voice say “drop the bow”
- She drops it
- “Turn around slowly”
- 5 figures, humanoid, clad in ceremonial metallic armor
- Each have long colorful hair in different braids and warpaint, glowing eyes
- Each has a giant glave (shuriken like, can be thrown, doubles as shield)
- Behind them is a giant cat/puma with a harness, a night elf is riding it
- Juniper is accused of being a spy, bound and gagged and led back to the night elf camp. She does her best to leave noticeable tracks as she walks and keeps good track of her location
- She is brought to a Night Elven military outpost, all of her belongings are taken
- She is told that the captain will see her soon
- Meanwhile, its now been awhile since we’ve seen Juniper
  - Isi tries to message her on the sending stone, no response
  - Looking around, Isi notices that there is another owl next to Scintilla, watching the group
  - It flies away when the group spots it and Alyrin sends Scintilla after
  - Scintilla follows the owl back to two night elves but is seen by them
- The group now knows that the night elves know theyre there
- We continue following the tracks, find the area where Juniper was kidnapped
- We follow the tracks to the camp, but the camp seems dead
  - Everyone except isi is doing a bad job talking quietly about our bomb plan
- Isi decides to go off on her own and look for juniper

- Alyrin announces herself and is accused of being a traitor
  - Adelaide drops her rapier, isi comes out of hiding
- Alyrin calls down moonlight and starts avatar form to demonstrate that she is a servant of elune
  - She is accused of this being a falsehood
  - Clad in bright blue moonlight, she begins to chant the Sentinels prayer
  - The captain joins in, and sees Alyrin is telling the truth
  - Alyrin explains the quest that she has been given by Elune, and the corruption we encountered
    - Isi nat 20s persuasion about being no harm
- Captain- Lieutenant Aeodira Thunderseeker- sent scout to check on the nearby druid enclave
  - Scout did not return
  - Alyrin suggests the corruption may have been to blame
- Captain says she will let us go to Moonglade
  - Suggests we talk to Keeper Ordanus (Cenarious’ son) at Raynewood Retreat
    - Cenarious is a god, the son of Elune and the one who taught druidic magics to the Elves
  - Raynewood retreat is intended to keep back the corruption of the Felwood
  - Captain will give us missive granting us safe passage
- Archdruid Fandrul, leader of the cenarion circle, has not been forthcoming with the night elves about whats going on
  - Not Malfurion??
  - Malfurion has not been seen since the burning of Nordrassil

- Dark side of elune
  - Similar to manhunt, but when only one person is left, it goes into challenge mode where the chasers cant use their hands

- Effective immediately, moonball is banned at the outpost
- Our escorts are Aimer and Aila (seems to be roughly middle aged)
- We start off, taking the main road
- After about an hour, something feels off

- We prepare a litter and put Alyrins body on it
- Lieutenant Aeodira Thunderseeker returns with several soldiers, she will personally escort us to Moonglade and pay her respects to Alyrin
- Faltharan river marks the border between horde and alliance territories
- We make it safely to the island, avoiding a horde caravan and firbolgs of greenpaw village, part of the felwheel tribe
  - Firbolgs were once allies of the night elves, but the corruption has made them attack anyone on sight, including firbolgs of other tribes
- Isi and Juniper dig a grave while ga’an and adelaide prepare the body (ga’an does the heavy lifting of the gory stuff)

- Isi tries to stay up to protect Alyrin but falls asleep immediately. Over the course of the night, she scooches closer and closer, eventually just fully spooning her
- There's a vibrancy to the area now. Before, it felt off, spooky. Now there’s vibrance, especially to the plant life. The wisps are significantly more numerous, dancing like fireflies around the night
- In the morning, Alyrin beelines for the food. It’s the first time she can smell and taste food in years. And this is the food she grew up on

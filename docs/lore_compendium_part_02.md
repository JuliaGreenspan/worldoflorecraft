- The GayteKeepërs are still at the lunch. Thrall puts down his turkey leg and says, "what will you all be doing now that we have finished your adventure?"
- Ga'an wants to get to First Home. Another troll tells Thrall it is a sacred place for the dark spear trolls who wish to attune themselves with the loa and prove themselves. A darkspear troll can never truly connect with the loa of their own will without doing so.
- Isilee asks for supplies or suggestions for supplies. He suggests a single potion of water breathing. He also suggests finding others who have expereicne with the isles, and skills like fishing, navigation, etc. Sen’jin Village, of which Ga’an is familiar, is a few days journey to the southern tip of Duratar. The larger group asks when we think we head out, we respond soon, likely in the next day.
- The troll tells Ga’an that he hopes Ga’an understands the importance(?)/task(?) of Ga’an’s passage to first home. He wishes Ga’an the best and impacts some wisdom into Ga’an. The troll we speak with was one of the last trolls to go to the isles prior to the sinking by the seawitch
- The troll asks how much we know about mitt romney. Since we know a bit of him, he explains that romney is a well known loa in the circle. He can tell Ga’an hopes to prove himself and that Ga’an has already been marked by the loa. The most important resource is going to be those that you keep around you, those that you see. The darkspear would not be alive today if we didn’t find friends in the orcs and the tauren. We come from different backgrounds and we rely on each other. Together we are stronger.
- Zalazane was the friend of the troll that we’re talking to. It was only by going together that they got out together. Time also passed different. What was less than a day was actually more than 3 months. Know those you can trust and why. You cannot do it alone.
- He calls Ga’an a fool for wanting to go up against Zelazane. He plays games with your minds, his power rivals or even exceeds that of this trolls father. Zelazane is a trickster. If you wish to even rival his power, Ga’an needs to go to first home and needs to converse with the loa.
- Ga’an makes fun of Juniper for having hooves because apparently it’s hard to swim with hooves.
- Alyrin talks to someone regarding getting to Moonglade, and that she should talk to some druids at the Grove of the Oliver Branch. Alyrin doesn’t know how to get to Moonglade and we didn’t ask the emissary from the Cenarian circle. It borders on the Fel wood, Winterspring and Dark Shore. To get that far north, you have to go pretty far North, which is very difficult, especially in Winter. Saoirse doesn’t think that going north is a good idea, and Alyrin thinks her brother is worth it.
- Thunderbluff is calling for aid given the recent increase in Quilborn raids and the Venture Company. Thrall asks for a moment and then thanks the Gaytekeepers. We offer to help, since the Horde is spread pretty thin. North Watch and the Quilborne, and in Ashara and Ashenvale are spreading resources really thin.
- Alyrin wanted to asks about all the banners in the throne room, with all the weird symbols.
- Thrall responds that the banners are the banners of the orc clans that compose the horde. The banner that we’re looking at, the burning blade, was once a very noble clan within the horde and some of its people are still within the horde. However, after coming to Azeroth, they became more of a cult and branched off to become demon worshippers. Bleeding Hallow, Warsong, Blackrock, Frost wolf, etc. The shattered hand is also one.
- Anyway, Thrall leaves, and we leave to go shopping. Isilee talks us up as we leave. Kardris Dreamseeker tells us to travel safely.
- We end up going to the Grove of the Olive Branch. We meet two tauren there, and Alyrin says we’re going to go because it would be really cool, but we don’t actually know how to get there. The tauren says that that’s an important detail (she’s being sarcastic lmao). The druids usually wild shape to get there. The alternative is to go to Fel Wood, and there lies a very secluded secret tunnel that is often used to bring visitors in. Our best bet is to find and take the tunnel to get there. She doesn’t have a map.
- You’re going to want to go to the very north tip of Fel wood. There’s a village of furbolg that lies to the north in the very northern reaches of Fel Wood. They were once very honorable, but the corruption that has created fel wood has changed and corrupted them, driven them to madness, but they were once protectors of this entryway. At the very northeastern edge, we’ll find the tunnel. The tunnel will lead us to Moonglade. The tunnel is small enough that we would need to walk single file. Its is under the boughs of a great tree. There’s no specific door, it hasn’t been used in a hot minute, so she doesn’t know what we need to get in.
- Our biggest barrier will likely be anyone guarding the tunnel from Fel Wood’s side or Moonglade’s side. The tribe that we are looking for is now known as the Fel Paw. The biggest barrier will be the tribe that stakes claim to that entrance. The tree is ancient. The tree will probably stick out.
- We went to Yelmacks and proceeded to do fast shopping.
- We went to the tavern and purchased food, alcohol, and water. We talk about going to the map store, then we head up to the room. Ga’an meditates.
- In the morning, Juniper purchases several maps, we all buy fanny packs, and then we bounce, with Juniper at the lead. Ga’an and Juniper both do herbalism checks and at the end of the day, everyone works on their own respective hobbies. Juniper casts goodberries in the morning, and passes them out in the evening. She also gives one to Stoga.
- Juniper casts alarm to wake up the party if anyone, excluding Adelaide and Lu'va, cross the boundry.
- We hear some kind of bird-like cry screech in the night, and more voices join in as a chorus. Naturally, we go towards the noise because we are brave and invincible adventurers.
- Juniper casts pass without a trace on the group, including Ga'an's two summoned shadows, Chad and Greg. We’re sneaking off to find the source. The canyon forks in numerous directions and we end up going upper right.
- Alyrin and Ga’an helped guide Juniper. Juniper does not want to hold the hand of Chad or Greg.
- We hear a similar, but louder, noise as we continue on the path. There’s blood on the trail, and Alyrin can hear the sounds of tearing.
- Juniper starts walking mindlessly towards something, down the path. She’s staring distantly, and she’s kind of in a fugue state. There’s a beautiful, melodic sound playing. The shadows can also be charmed, and both Greg and Chad begin following Juniper.
- Ga’an dismisses both Chad and Greg.
- Juniper is walking forward ahead of the group under some kind of spell.
- Isilee, Ga’an, and Alyrin have to run to catch up with her. As they catch up, we see these large creature with large wings, arms, and terrifying beast things. Combat begins. Juniper really wants to be with the birds, but then she snaps out of it. Then, Juniper gets charmed again, while the rest of the party does not. Soairse, Alyrin, Isilee, and Ga’an continue to fight the harpies.
- Juniper has not succeeded on a single saving throw against these harpies.
- Isilee also gets caught by one of the harpies in a different turn.
- Everyone breaks free, thanks to Ga’an, Saoirse, and Alyrin. The harpies are disposed of with some fairly excessive violence. The gang rolls some checks to find some treasures and feathers.

- The GayteKeepërs arrive in Sen'jin Village after dark, where they are stopped by Watcher Voone. He lets the group pass when he recognizes Ga'an, but informs them that the town is on edge after the previous night's raid. Voone alerts Ga'an that he should check on his family, whose home was hit hard in the attack
- As the party walks to Ga'an's family's hut, Ga'an is stricken by the memory of the raid which took his father and left his mother crippled. Ga'an had hid under the table, paralyzed by fear. His younger brother saved the life of both Ga'an and his mother.
- The orb of teleportation begins to glow as they reach Ga'an's home, and out pops Adelaide
- Isilee gives Adelaide a hug and they quickly catch up on the last 10 days before Ga'an knocks on the door to his family's hut
- Inside, they meet Ga'an's mother, Molla, who is now bound to a makeshift wheelchair. She is delighted to see her son, but still distressed over the condition of Ga'an's brother, Volza, who lost an arm in the attack. He is currently sleeping, but his recovery has been unnaturally slow-- there is belief in the village that the raiders may have begun coating their weapons with something that impedes healing.
- Molla is also concerned by Ga'an's appearance. She initially laughs when he tells her of his communications with Bwonsamdi, but sobers when she realizes it isn't a joke. Molla suggests Ga'an consult with Gadrin about this, warning that Bwonsamdi "does not just give"
- Ga'an quickly introduces the rest of the party to his mother, but quickly ushers them out and leads the group to the Loa's Shrine Inn
- The inn is run by a Troll named Drek, from whom the party rents two rooms for the night.
- The party attempts to get Ga'an to open up, but he is guarded and evasive.
- In the morning, the group encounter Watcher Voone once more in the tavern, and engage him in conversation about Ga'an's quest for First Home. Voone is skeptical of how the party plans to go somewhere that is now under water, but suggests they speak to Vashi, who runs the Sen'jinn shipyard. She is one of the troll sailors who did not leave to enlist in the Horde navy, and can likely assist them in reaching Darkspear.
- Now seeing the village in daylight, The Echo Isles are visible across the water. It is filled with lush palm trees which have begun to claim the large Mayan-esque stone structures on the shore.
- The party return to Ga'an's home. Volza is still sleeping, but Molla is awake and happy to see Ga'an. She is interested in hearing of the party's exploits and tells Ga'an that his father Cu'ul would be proud of him.
- Isilee snoops around the hut and accidently knocks to the floor a case containing two ceremonial necklaces, much to Molla's distress. These were the necklaces that she and Ga'an's father wore to symbolize their marriage, and Ga'an has not seen them since his father was taken.
- Volza finally wakes up and is excited to see his brother. He is in terrible shape, depsite his natural Troll regenerative abilities. He's little more than a child, with his tusks just starting to come in, one at a crooked angle. Volza and Molla both have golden eyes, unlike Ga'an's stark blue.
- An unfortunate comment about Volza's severed limb gets the party more or less kicked out, and Ga'an is given a list of errands to run for his mother. When Ga'an returns from these errands, Gadrin and his assistant Bom'bay are at the hut, speaking to his mother.
- Gadrin is visibly uneasy at Ga'an's appearance, and warns him of the dangers of dealing with Bwonsamdi. Ga'an brushes him and his mother off, insisting that he knows what Bwonsamdi wants from him in return, and is not concerned about doing it.

- The GayteKeepërs visit Jojo's Mojo and sell the Orb of Time for 500 gold, lying about it possessing Wild Magic capabilities.
- The party travels to the beach to await the return of the fishing ships. In the meantime, Ga'an casts Water-breathing on the group and everyone begins to experiment with swimming and fighting underwater.
  - Wanting to test their abilities, the party swims out to investigate an old shipwreck. They find it filled with crab people (Makrura), and decide to return later when they are more prepared for a fight,
- Swimming back to shore, the party meet the head of the shipyard, Vashi, and her husband A'thian.
  - A'thian remembers the region where the Darkspear Islands once were. He can spare himself and two others to aid in navigating to the islands,
  - They will charge a rate of 15 GP/day for their services, and will need the party to secure a seafaring vessel and crew in Bladefist Bay.
- Darkspear should be roughly six days from Bladefist if the winds are good, and it will take two or three days from Sen'jin Village to reach Bladefist,
  - A'thian agrees to depart the day after tomorrow, setting sail at 6am. He will be joined by Sam'gha and Mi'zae as navigators.

- Upon entering the ship, the Gaytekeepërs find several decaying bodies, some of which appear to have been Forsaken.
  - OOC, we realize these are the bodies of our one shot characters
  - The party loots the ships remains, uncovering a lute engraved with, "*To my biggest fan, Este. Love, Saylor Twift*". They also uncover a significant amount of coin, a sealed ceramic jar, two spell scrolls, several potions, and a handful of gems.
- Several methods were attempted to bring the Makrura to shore as they would fetch a high price, but the group is ultimately unsuccessful.
- Arriving back on land, the party accompanies Ga'an as he seeks out Mother Norn'sa. She can be found in the back room of JoJo's. Isilee sells the cursed fel blade from Ragefire Chasm to JoJo before entering Mother Norn'sa's room.
- Mother Norn'sa's room is cluttered and dimly lit. The room is decorated with dozens of pieces of driftwood.
  - Norn'sa sits in the center of the room, carving the driftwood with a Troll tusk. She tells Ga'an that he's been expected, and explains that everyone in the village has a piece of driftwood, which helps her interpret the spirits. She chides Ga'an for not visiting her before setting out from Sen'jin Village the first time.
- Norn'sa begins a reading for Ga'an, pulling out a brazier and a bag of carved bones. She holds Ga'an's driftwood over the fire and allows Ga'an to take it. He hears Bwonsamdi's voice echo in his mind as he does so.
  - Ga'an struggles at first to clear his mind, which Mother Norn'sa notes as she mutters her incantations. Ga'a'n finally lets go of his apprehensions and feels a warmth travel through his hands into his arms, chest, and head.
  - Light flashes from both their eyes and the room is plunged into darkness.
  - Everyone feels weightless, and is unable to see anything. Feelings of loneliness pervade the space and no sound exists.
- A blue green flame bursts from the brazier and shadows dance around the room. The drift wood floats on its own over the ghostly flames. Her voice now fills the room with renewed vigor.
  - The spirits tell her all. Coldness consumes Ga'an. A cold presence takes over the room, as if the party are all caught in a blizzard.
- Norn'sa speaks of a burning hatred for a single troll that has taken almost everything from Ga'an
  - The burning carvings coalesce into the eerie tribal mask of Zalazane. A low maniacal laughter begins to fill the room.
  - The party closes their eyes and reopens them to find the mask has disappeared. Now, the tent is filled with firelight and embers and smoke fill the air. There is no visible source of this, and shadows of fleeing trolls dance across the tent.
- A single tall silhouette is behind Mother Norn'sa. A single voice calls out, "Molla, where are you?"
  - The silhoute is attacked by a shadow, and is shot in the shoulder and tackled to the ground.
  - Norn'sa muses that hatred drives Ga'an, and he seeks power in order to achieve his vengeance. At what cost will this come?
- The flame begins to turn black and grey, and new carvings on the driftwood begin to glow.
  - The sigils float into the air and float into the air toward Ga'an, but he can't move or do anything. When he looks down, he sees dark shadowy chains reaching out of the ground to hold him in place. The symbols collide with his chest and all of his tattoos begin to glow with the same color, radiating even through the armor. An agreement he doesn't know the terms to, Norn'sa sees all of this.
- The flame shifts to a light blue color, and the sound and smell of the sea fills the air.
  - The destination is Darkspear Isles. It lies beneath the ocean. The light filtering through the canvas begins to darken as if going deeper and deeper into the ocean. Suddenly, hundreds of burning orange eyes with slit pupils can be seen on the canvas, a deep voice reverberates, "WATCHING". There is something ancient about the voice. The minions of this ancient evil now guard the island. A whirlpool and mist on the surface, and nothing to hide you below the sees.
  - Shadows will be the party's ally on this journey. That which they seek remains untouched, protected by the will of the Loa.
  - The shadowy troll silhouette of Bwonsamdi appears, and with it chains that stretch from Ga'an to his hands.
- Norn'sa warns that First Home is not a place of peace or safety. Those who travel there will be tested by the loa. The spirits hide survival or death from her visions.
  - The journey will be treacherous, and the party will have no experience with this enemy. The spirits don't even fully understand this evil, an evil older than Azeroth itself. The minions have pledged their allegiance to this darkness. Shadows and Caution will be their friend. Don't kick the nest, use stealth.
  - Should Ga'an fail, the village will be doomed. Should Ga'an succeed, that will not be the end of his trials. This will just be the first test.
- The fire shifts to a golden yellow color. The ocean air fades and is replaced with an arid intense heat. The silhouette of Bwonsamdi can still be seen, along with the endless deserts of Tanaris.
  - The Farraki trolls in the city of Zul Furak have been lead astray by an eldritch evil, Ueetay No Mueh'zala.
  - Blood begins to trickle from Norn'sa's nose, and the earth trembles. A silhouette much larger than Bwonsamdi appears.
  - Through the efforts of Bwonsamdi, the original keeper of souls has been almost erased.
- Ga'an asks of Norn'sa, should hesucceed, what will Bwonsamdi ask of him next?
  - The silhouette fades, but the eyes of Bwonsamdi remain just a second longer. A raspy menacing laugh echoes through the room, the voice of Bwonsamdi.
- The last time multiple people went to first home together was Vol'jin and Zalazane. Those who go to first home don't return the same people they were before they left.
  - Did the trials Zalazane underwent cause him to go mad and attack the trolls, or was it always his path?
  - Norn'sa pulls out Zalazane's driftwood, and says the spirits don't give absolutes. Fate and destiny are often guided but they aren't set in stone. The only absolutes are a beginning and an end.
  - Zalazane was given a choice at first home, and he chose the path that hurt many. Ga'an will have a choice at first home as well.
  - Our enemies are those who chose to follow evil, whether at first home or at Zul Furak.
- Norn'sa warns: "Don't be stupid Ga'an, beware the minions of the eldritch entity that lie beneath the waves. The sea witch and her ilk should not be disturbed lightly. Use caution and be wary of the mists and whirlpool that protect their kingdom."
- Norn'sa then turns to Adelade and says, "Mina misses you".
  - Adelaide immediately leaves the room
- Norn'sa tells Alyrin "the Emerald Dream awaits", says that Isilee is looking for a family, and that Juniper should check in on hers.
- With the ritual over, the party finds that Adelaide has completely left the building. They begin to search for her, and Isilee finds her at the beach, staring out at the tides.
  - The two have a heart to heart, and Adelaide confides that she broke when Mina died, and has felt that everything else that's followed is meaningless.

- The party wakes up in the morning and sees the troll sailors preparing to depart.
- Juniper rolls around in the dirt. Isilee lies to Juniper that the plan was to jump overboard if we were attacked.
- The boat pushes off and the party is off again. However, where previously the boat stayed close to shore, now the shore is no longer in sight.
- Ga’an and Alyrin keep watch, but notice nothing throughout the day. Ga’an spends some time shaving copper dust.
- Eventually, the ship makes camp once more north of Tygard
- Ga’an with help from Juniper surveys the camp but finds nothing unexpected. The camp was marked with a the troll symbol for safe home.
- Isilee starts befriending Dentula and Tynoom while Ga'an makes a potion of healing.
- Juniper blows Alryrin up with a trap book. Oops.
- Upon arrival in Bladefist, the party goes to meet dockmaster Trapi Keenbol to charter a ship, who recommends that the GayteKeepërs speak with Captain Stormfang on dock three.
  - Trapi explains that charter rates are usually based on the captain. Stormfang has a crew of 12, so it could be up to 50 gold per day.
- The party meet with Captain Stormfang and reach an agreement to charter *The Jewel of the Horde* for up to four weeks. The price is a sum of 1200 GP, half of which must be paid upfront. The ship will set out at first light.
- The party decides to run some errands in Orgrimmar before setting out. A stop at Red Canyon Mining and Jewel Crafting proves particularly lucrative due to the use of moonlight calm on one of the two blood elf twins.

- More errands! Madam Marem, Rekul's Poisons, and a brothel [Adelaide will remember this.]
- Ga’an procures a Tome of Understanding which will boost his wisdom. He will be reading it for the foreseeable future.
- The party splits up to check out Dark Briar Lodge while Ga'an consults the Witch Doctors in the Valley of Spirits. Ga'an hears a strange laughter as he walks past the shrine of Bwomsamdi, but is pulled out of his trance by the apprentice witch doctor, Ur'kyo. He is then brought to meet the head witch doctor X'yera.
  - X'yeara tells Ga'an that when the Isles stood, they were scattered and disparate. They only unified when first the Alliance attacked, followed by the Seawitch. Ga'an is the first mortal that the Loa have taken personal interest in since Vol'jin. He is likely to be tested by Bwonsamdi personally.
  - The Loa are very powerful, and some are more forgiving than others. Some provide wisdom (Gonk) and how to be one with nature. Kragwa can be fickle but very loyal. Some are treacherous (Ganbala) the loa of serpents. Bwonsamdi is not as fickle as the Loa of serpents, but everything is transactional. The question must be “what will this mean for me?”
- X'yera further explains that the Trolls were once part of an empire called the Gurabashi. The remnants of this civilization can be found in the forests of Stranglethorn. They are not very friendly. The Farraki were once part of the Gurabashi but moved on and left.
  - The Zandalari came before the Gurabashi. They ruled all of Azeroth for a very long time before the Night Elves struck them down. During the time of this empire, there was a priest to a god of death who proved himself worthy of power and trust. The legends speak of this god of death - one who has been forgotten. One who craved endless sacrifices. This follower saw this, and after receiving his power, turned on this nameless god and seized power for himself.
    - This forgotten god has endless hunger and unmatched cruelty. It was said that a deal was struck between him and Bwonsamdi in order to seal him away for all of time. The book is damaged, much has been removed. Ga’an is hallucinating his name onto the page of the damaged book.
  - X'yera warns that If someone were to try to bring the old loa of death into this world, it would destroy everything.
- The Loa live many planes. Some live in the emerald dream, some in this world and some in the plane of death (Bwonsamdi). The Loa cannot travel freely, but some radical cultists have attempted to bring the nameless god, but this would mark doomsday for all mortal races.
- The Witch Doctors have only met one Farraki, who managed to flee before being sacrificed. Her name was Batam'si. She refused to speak to anyone about it. She stayed at the Valley of Spirits for a time, but departed years ago, heading south. She may have headed into the Barrens at some point.
- When X’yera was young, he underwent the trial of First Home himself. Even now he is uncertain what is real and what is an illusion. Reality is different there, a protected site where the Loa can almost freely move between. The whole party will be tested and potentially separated. They will never know if what they see is true, or a test. Not all are fit for First Home. Many are never ready and die in the trial, or stagnate and fail to push forward.
- Further information about the Loa:
  - Hireek the loa of the midnight sky or the loa of treachery can provide stealth and silence
  - Kragwa can provide strength
  - The loa golden eagle can provide health
  - Shengo can provide us with safe travels and clear skies
  - Shirvala can provide strength and protection in battle
  - Gonk can provide intelligence and the hunt.
- Back at the tavern, the party learns to play the card game "Call of the Banshee". Garuk, a young orc down on his luck, finally won and we were all happy for him.
- Adelaide sneaks out at night to acquire some "company". She is not as sneaky as she would like and the party notices her disappearance and flips their shit. There is a confrontation about it in the morning and a fair amount of tension in the party.

- In the morning, the party meet the first mate of the *Jewel,* a Tauren named Izha Strongwind. They pay the first half of the fee and the ship begins to set sail. Juniper has some awkward Tauren bonding but manages not to faint.
  - Izha tells everyone of the recent quillboar attacks in Mulgore, alongside the drought in the Barrens and Stone Talon. In addition, the Venture Company have been invading the area and set up a processing plant at Windshear Crag.
- Alyrin summons a frog using her hat. Ga’an tries to eat the frog, but it turns to dust.
- North Watch ships attack the *Jewel*, but fuck around and find out.
- Ga’an casts scorcher during the fight, and accidently ignites the ships gunpowder stores. This was not what he expected to happen.
- Alyrin is knocked unconscious, and then “healed” by the blood elf bard, Velarise. Luckily, she is stabilized by her necklace.
- The party investigates the scorched remnants of the North Watch ship, uncovering the following:
  - A wooden lock box lined with lead. Inside is a broken holy symbol, as well as a badly worn libram to the light, with pages ripped out and "lies" scratched over the text, as well as the phrase "the hour of twilight is at hand" and "In darkness, there are infinite paths"
  - A missive written to Lady Admiral Proudmoore referencing her "late husband" and "the traitorous Lady Jaina Proudmoore"
  - A small necklace with a gold pendant in the shape of an eye with a slit-pupil. The necklace itself does not possess any magical properties, but the person in possession of it hears a deep voice like in Mother Norn'sa's hut which warns, "WATCHING"
  - A diary of a Kul Tiran sailor chronicling his descent into madness over the course of his voyage. The diary notes that the crew was denied entry first into Silvermoon due to the Blood Elves joining the Horde, then into Gilneas. They were able to trade some goods at the dock but denied the ability to restock food or enter the city due to food shortages and fear of another outbreak of the undead plague. The city also is rumored to be swept up in a civil war and dealing with a dark curse in the countryside that twists people into "savage wolf men". They also learned in Stormwind that the country is wracked by civil war with the Defias Brotherhood. In addition, King Varian went missing en route on a diplomatic mission to Theramore, leaving the ten year old Anduin as King and Bolvar Fordragon as his Regent Lord. The diary begins to contains phrases such as "the hour of twilight", "infinite possibilities", "the Black Empire", and "may the shadow of C'thun guide me". The pages also contain an illustration of
    - An octopus-shaped silhouette with a variety of sharp spines covering its immense body and tentacles.
    - An immense Ziggurat and hellish landscape dotted with obelisks and structures overlooked by a giant octopus-like creature with a giant eye above its head.
    - An immense ancient city with a sealed gate.
  - The sailor's diary describes being plagued by whispers of "watching" and "infinite possibilites". A visit to the Night Elven tree of Teldrassil yielded a nightmare in which the tree's reflection in the still water grew unnatural spike-like growths on the trunk that glowed a crimson red. Dark energy poured out from its branches and gave the tree an ominous aura. Monsters and abominations of flesh, tentacles, eyes, and teeth crawled from the holes and crevices littering its surface. A familiar voice rang out: "New Beginning". The sailor soon begins to talk of the need to go to the desert to "break him out" from "behind that accursed wall". He prays "may the shadow of C'thun guide me" and writes "C'thun how I long witness your awesome might".
- Back on the *Jewel*, Captain Stormfang is understandably PO'd about the damage to his ship but the party compensates him well for the damages to smooth things over.
- Adelaide writes a missive to Jes'rimmon detailing the findings and Alyrin sends Scintilla to deliver the message.

- The party unpacks the revelations of the last session further. Alyrin/Adelaide recall that the "Hour of Twilight" refers to an armageddon whereby all life is snuffed out in the entire great beyond in an instant.
- Velarise comes to apologize to Alyrin for almost killing her. The Gatekeepërs learn that she is 85 years old (relatively young for a Blood/High Elf, but older than Adelaide). She comes from Fairbreeze, a farming community in Western Quel'thalas. Adelaide is very snobby about this and Velarise leaves, dejected.
- Isilee opens up a bit more about her own life story. She knew Pietro as a child in Lordaeron and was partners-in-petty-crime with him. When her mother grew ill, her father took her to Silvermoon, "the only good thing he ever did" for her.
  - She is cagey in her answer about how she met Pietro again as an adult and where she was after being in Silvermoon.
- A'thian shows the party a map of Darkspear, identifying First Home for the group. The party decides to stop at the Temple of the Loa and Dazduga Shrine to make the proper tribute to the Loa before entering first home.
- As the ship sails nearer to the isles, Ga’an is kept awake that night with apprehension. What will Darkspear look like? What will have changed? Ga’an remembers hunts and adventures around the island, rituals celebrating Gonk and other Loa.
- The entire ship is awakened in the night by an attack of Naga. One of the crew dies in the attack, and Stormfang grows furious when he overhears talk of occult symbols brought on board by the team. Alyrin's Moonlight Calm saves the day for the party to not be thrown overboard.
- The party debate tossing the lead-lined box overboard but decide against it.
- In the morning, the ship sails into a heavy mist that is magical and unable to be dispelled by Adelaide.
- Ga'an's tattoos glow purple, a beacon pointing in the direction of First Home.
- The Gaytekeepërs have a Tusk Love book club/cuddle puddle to pass the time.
- Fish attack!

- The party convene on deck to discuss the plan. Lu'va is sent to scout and discovers that Dazduga volcano is between the ship and the center of the whirlpool. The volcano is immense and dotted with structures at its base. There seems to be a shelf on the seafloor with a multitude of dilapidated stone structures. Traveling further, she then comes across structures built of different materials, as well as shattered boats similar in design to those in Sen'jin. Further in are mounds and buildings similar to islands, and a very intact stone structure.
- Trolls historically do not build with stone, so Lu'va's findings are puzzling to the party.
- Before they depart, A'thien tells the party of his sister, Go'ze, who was once an aspiring Witch Doctor who traveled to First Home. He asks that the group please pay Go'ze the proper respects.
  - Note: this was forgotten about immediately and we absolutely did not do this
- The party dives into the ocean and begins to explore the stone city. The area is largely leveled and destroyed. Adelaide and Alyrin identify that the architecture of these ruins appears to be Night Elven, prior to the separation of the High Elves and Night Elves. This was long ago before the Sundering, when the world was one continent. The city may have sunken during the Sundering, when the world split.
  - Adelaide is geeking out about this
- The party comes across a troll ship that likely came from when the trolls were fleeing the island. Inside is several troll corpses; a family that never escaped.
- Further on, whispers in Elven start to permeate the area, reliving the last moments of the city. The Gaytekeepërs approach the intact building, and start to notice iconography of Elune. The sound of crying starts to stand out. It is near the building that looks like it could be a Temple to Elune.
- The crying is coming from the ghost of a Night Elven child named Thalia. She is upset that she can't pick up her doll. She says that her mother, a priestess, is angry at her. She last saw her mother in the mausoleum.
- The party agree to seek out her mother and journey into the mausoleum. Inside it is a statue of a female elf looking upward towards the sky. In her hand is a large diamond. Unlike the other statues, there is no damage
- The party fight a banshee and some will o'wisps, and struggle to solve a elementary school level riddle but finally achieve success. In reward, they are granted a pearl of power and a large diamond.
- Thalia is reunited with her mother and their souls are at last set free to find their final resting place.

- Ga’an leads the party forward while Isilee looks for treasure.
- As they are traveling, Ga’an sees a patch of seaweed that is razor sharp, but they are able to avoid the seaweed.
- Alyrin thinks she is hallucinating the buildings intact, and experiences flashbacks to when she was a child prior to the sundering.
- A chill starts to crawl down the backs of everyone's spines. As the team proceeds through a new section of the ruins, they come across the base of a tower. Alyrin sees a flash of light before it dwindles away.
- The party is ambushed by undead ghosty things. Ga’an drinks their souls.
- The group proceedes forward. As they approach Dazduga mountain, the volcanic activity picks up. Ga’an barely keeps Alyrin from jumping into a volcanic vent.
- Ga’an meditates during a short rest at the base of the shelf. As he focused in on the feeling of the purple mark that had been on his chest, Ga’an finds himself within his own mind in silence. He opens his eyes and finds himself in a familiar dark space. As he looks around, he realizes that he is spalshing around in knee deep water. Illuminating the space is the blue light of the distant moon. He can’t see further than 5 feet around himself. In the distance he sees 2 beacons, that rapidly turns to 3 beacons, then 4. As he steps towards the beacons, it looks as if 3 are clustered together and 1 is separate, further away.
- They proceed to swim forward and begin approaching the volcano. As they travel towards what was left of Dazduga shrine, they begin to see creatures swimming around, humaoid creatures with legs, but fish-like features. They keep having to duck into rock crevices to hide away. The creatures have pale green skin, crusted with barnacles. Some have tentacles, various aquatic fishlike features. They all look different. Some have humanoid features, some look troll like, or human like features. Some have elven features. They occasionally speak a language but nothing that the party recognizes.
- Isilee stealths ahead to peak over the wall of the temple. She sees massive fissures, filled with lava, pouring out into the ocean. She sees a few figures at the shrine, marching up to the lava pool. As they move to the lava, one seems to stay back. This one seems to have 4 arms. She speaks words praising Ragnaros, and the old gods, and asking them to bestow power upon them. The other 3 individuals dunk themselves in the lava
- Adelaide remembers that Ragnaros is the elemental lord of fire, enslaved by the old gods
- A fight ensues. In the aftermath, Ga dissects the fire Naga. The Naga's skin has a magmatic sheen, and his heart has a magmatic essence. Sort of like an elemental fire mixed with biological tissue. Ga’an wants to offer the heart to Krag’wa.

- Ga’an leads the party to his family's former home of Zul’dara. At the island, and as they approach they see glowing purple lights, not Loa vibes and not undead vibes. They hide behind a tree to avoid a patrol and proceed forward. A sort of mosslike growth seems to be collecting on the trees. Ga’an tries to collect some, and is badly injured by a frostbite/freezing cold from the moss.
- The party draws closer to the village and realize that the purple lights are crystals, and people are still living in the village (just not trolls).
- They proceed south through the forest to the area where Ga’ans home once was. Upon arriving in the clearing, the coast is clear and Ga’an enters into the remnants of his hut. Memories flash before his eyes and he is brought back to the old days.
- He begins by looking through the ritual masks, tattered, broken and bleached by time and the sea. Much of the paints are weathered off. Something catches his eye: a small white shape buried amongst the rubble. He pulls out a small ornate knife that has been carved from bone, barely larger than Ga’ans finger. A small crack runs down the sheath, brittle from the ocean. The knife is as sharp as Ga’an remembers.
  - A memory flashes through his mind. His first hunt, the knife carved from the tooth of his father’s first trophy kill. Ga’an was never meant to lose it, but it couldn’t be retrieved before boarding the ship.
- The others can’t find anything of interest searching the house, but Ga’an finds a piece of wood from the home that is still mostly intact.
- They proceed towards the Temple of the Loa. As they pass towards the temple they find piranha-esque fish but Ga’an is able to chart a path around them.
- As they approach the temple, the party sees the large stone wall with a huge tower, where the whirlpool originates. Ga’an notices those similar purple lights as they bob along the walls.
- Eventually they arrive at the temple, an immense Ziggurat-like structure. Many of the carvings have been damaged by the sea and destroyed. Sections of the temple seem to be caved in and destroyed. For the most part, it is the decorations are what has been damaged.
- Ga’an remembers coming here on market days with his father to sell hunting goods. There were many tiers to the temple, and different people went to different areas for different needs.
- Down the staircase is a ruined relief of a witch doctor traversing first home. This was once a place where acolytes and priests lived. Walls are caked in algae like growth.
- The furthest southern room (kitchen) is destroyed and caved in. Spots in the stonework are uncovered and glossy on the walls.
- SNAIL FIGHT

- Adelaide casts tiny hut and all take a long rest
- As Ga’an falls asleep, he finds himself in the endless black void.
  - It feels as if an eternity passes, wading through knee deep water. Echos reverberate out from the splashing. No light permeates the area, and Ga’an can barely see his hands in front of his face. Suddenly, when he turns around he can see a beachfront, and Ga’an is knee deep in the surf. As he walks forward onto the beach front, he sees a thick, dense forest. As he approaches, the trees move out of the way. Ga’an strides forward, following the path laid out by the trees. As he walks forward, the trees close in behind him. There is no way but forward. There is a cacophony of sound, birds, insects. Eventually the path empties out into a clearing. In the clearing is a hut, the hut from Ga’ans childhood. But this hut is pristine. It looks as if the day they fled the islands. Ga’an is reminded of the attack from Zalazane, fleeing his home for the second time. The interior of the hut is pitch black. Ga’an opens the door and enters. However, the door slams shut behind him, and he is once more in the endless void. Behind Ga’an is a table with a single lit candle. A chair is pulled out beckoning him to sit.
  - Ga’an sits down, and Bwonsamdi sits before him. Ga’an talks to Bwonsamdi, and it is implied that Bwonsamdi wants results, sooner rather than later.
- Meanwhile, the rest of the party shares a different dreaM;
  - They find themselves swimming in a black void. They can't stop, if they stop, they will die. They can see the silhouettes of dead humanoids floating all around, hundreds of bodies. A deep voice says "Let go". The voice comes from a small fish. "We have not forgotten, we have not forgiven. I have tasted every one of your powers; you are nothing. I AM A GOD."
- The party awaken and divide the snail shell into:
  - 4 Breastplate sized pieces
  - 7 dish plate sized pieces
  - 2 Ga’an's palm sized pieces
- The party is ambushed by some fish people. They kill them and proceed forward.
- Ga’an enters the next room, and sees glowing purple lights and ruins. A dais has a large cauldron and blue glowing runes. At a rickety table, Ga’an sees a table with a non moving humanoid shape sitting at the table.
- There are people in the room. Three human women, one of them an old lady. All are bound and dressed in tattered rags. They claim to be sailors sailing from Stormwind to Theramoore, caught in the whirlpool. Adelaide casts Dispel Magic and the old lady is revealed to be a sea hag.
- A grueling fight commences, with a brief pause to plead for mercy. Ga'an refuses to offer his knife as a tribute, though Isilee offers a necklace the party has not seen before and tries to negotiate a deal that will require a contract signed in blood. The fight begins again and the team is (barely) triumphant, TPK avoided.

- The party investigates the Hag's room. Isilee finds a boatload of biological things, teeth, claws, eyes, bits, etc… Box o’Organs
- Ga’an inspects the body on the table, split open as if it was being dissected. Most of the organs have been removed. Some other things have been added, inhuman organs that Ga’an doesn’t necessarily recognize. Possibly human, but hard to be certain. Some of the skin has been removed and fish scales placed on these spots. The magic is a very old magic that Adelaid has never dealt with.
- Isilee confronts Ga’an about his refusal to give the witch the bone dagger.
- Isilee scouts ahead to the south, and finds a collapsed hallway they can squeeze through. They follow her through the door.
- They explore the center room, and don’t really find anything. The staircases going to the lower level are filled in with sand and rubble. It appears they are inaccessible.
- They look in the storage room to the southeast, and after a brief fight with the mephits, investigate the storeroom. They find 600 gold, 600 silver, 900 copper, ruined robes and vestments destroyed by the sea, and ruined ritual items, fetishes and masks. There is also an opaque white stone and an opaque crimson stone, translucent dark green stone, translucent rich gold stone (opaque and smooth to the touch), translucent stone with circles of grey white and green, other stones, 2 bottles (still corked) one has a thick red viscous liquid, and the other has a blue liquid with a silvery shimmer. A small pouch with 3 knuckle bones, one side has a happy face and the other has a sad face. The last item is a golden shimmering chain, with 5 reddish orange spherical gems.
- Finally, they come across an ornate light balanced decorative hand axe, covered in tribal markings. There appears to be tigers claws on one side. This is a +1 finesse hand axe of Shirvala.
- Investigation of the Seance room finds piles of bones and pieces of creatures littering the floor. Also piles of coin are present: 2300 copper, 1700 silver, 40 gold, we find a bottle containing a thick red liquid with a silvery color. There is also a necklace of five fireball beads which the party splits so everyone has one.
- Ga’an has a recollection of the banner, he remembers the day they fled the island. It started with a human attack from Kul’Tiras, and the banner looks similar to the Kul’Tiran ships and sails. First strangers came to the island, these people were the orcs, fleeing from the eastern kingdoms. They were welcomed with open arms. A week later, human ships - the Kul’Tiras attacked. They first attacked the troll outpost, and then spread to attacking trolls. A few days after that the sea witch sank the island.
- Ga'an walks the party through the proper rituals, and Ga’an leaves the rib bone of the demon enforcer for Samedi. Isilee prays to Shadra, and leaves a mirror. Juniper prayed to Shirvallah.
- Climbing to the top of the temple, they destroy a Naga statue at the top and complete the rituals to Gonk and Bwonsamedi. Ga'an gives Gonk the heart of Ragnaros’s chosen.
- The party ventures on from the Temple to the Tomb of the Old Ones, encountering a Ley Line dead spot along the way where magic is dissipated. They map its boundaries and avoid it.
- The left side of the Tomb is collapsed, but the right side is intact. Ga’an discovers the tomb of the high priest Jeram, whose mask was oddly intact and able to be reached. Ga’an recalls that Jeram was the high priest, well respected. He was referred to as the chosen of Samedi. He died shortly before Ga’an was born.
- Ga’an takes the mask and puts it on. He hears a whisper, "Make the darkspear proud".

- Everyone but Juniper has a shared dream/vision, the same as the night before. They are sinking in a deep ocean, slowly following. As they tire, they fall to the depths. As they struggle trying to keep from sinking away. There is a voice telling them to let go. A small fish is circling their heads
  - Ga’an declares him false and declares that Gral is the true lord of the sea. This angers the creature, who responds "I am the original, I was here before your gods. I will be here after. The Black Empire is very real, long before all were the Old Gods". "Buried deep beneath the earth is a power. The chains will break soon and I will destroy each and every one of you.
  - The vortex is their doom.
- The party discuss their shared dreams in the morning. Adelaide explains that Void is antithesis of light - the opposite of those who draw upon the light. The capital "T" Theory behind this is that there are dimensions that are behind/beyond our own. Light and void have never been traversed as far as mortals are concerned. The dimensions meet in a place of chaos, the twisting nether. It is believed that this can cause things to be created that are otherwise not meant to exist. Reality, demons, etc. spawn from the Void. It is believed that the ancient physical beings that ruled Azeroth were Void incarnate. For something to manifest from the void, it must be immensely powerful. A tenet of the void is that there is infinite possibility.
- Juniper had a spooky not fish dream. She was in Thunderbluff, prior to Thunderbluff's existance. Her parents eyes were melting and had tentacles and said they would never leave. Today is the first fay of Wintervale, a feast celebrating that the world has renewed again, an important day in Tauren culture
- The group stealths to the gate with no issues. Ga’an observes that the ground dips drastically there and that there were many small cramped hovels made of ruined stone and driftwood. The area is full of activity and there are many narrow streets. They are occupied by all the small fish folk (mrglefolk/murlocs) like the Gaytekeepërs saw with the Naga. There is also a large plateau with coral structures. This plateau has buildings/structures made of stone.
- The group decides to stealth through the slums to the southernmost gate. The idea is to sneak through and circle around southwest around the plateau.
- As they are stealthing, Isilee ends up finding a murloc and knifes him to death. They continue stealthing and they find a main throughfair. On the main road, there is a Naga. two mur’guls, a sea spawn and a weird lobster centaur creature.
- The party run across the road into an abandoned house. Alyrin uses invisibility to scout ahead, and finds a path forward. As they run forward, Isilee assassinates one murloc who was just minding his business working on his carving. Then another murloc ran around the corner, and got instantly knifed by Isilee. The Gaytekeepërs sprint to the edge of town and make it out without being seen.
- After exiting the gate, they notice multiple large fancy ruined buildings, which the party at first decide not to investigage. Adelaide has a change of heart and does a quick swim-through of the building with detect magic active. She borrows Isilee’s ring for this. She uncovers a magic box and a gem that seems to pull her in (but she resists it).
- The party proceedes toward First Home and sees that it is surrounded in stone walls.
- Isilee stealths to the top of the wall but rolled poorly on her perception check. Roll initiative.
- The party kills a naga and some murlocs, then books it down to First Home, which seems to be encased in a snowglobe-esque bubble that the Naga cannot enter.
- Adelaide tries to send a message to A'thian letting him know that the party made it to First Home. The message back is barely audible. This indicates that the Gaytekeepërs have entered another plane of existance.
- Ga'an prays to the loa, and a light starts to radiate from his chest. As he looks up, the trees start to move and shift to reveal a path.

- More Naga have gathered around the bubble of First Home. Isilee takes a quick break to investigate the box that Adelaide discovered and try to open it. She notices that there is a very powerful magical trap and is unsure what it does.
- Adelaide decides to hold off on doing anything with it since the spell protecting it is very high level and will probably TPK them. Isilee gathers sand.
- The party enters into the forests of First Home. It is dark, and very difficult to see. When they look up, all they can see is thick jungle canopy. Juniper opens her dagger. While at first, there is no breeze or noise, the party slowly becomes aware of insect sounds and the occasional bird call. Ga’an is in front leading the group deeper into the forest. There is no way to tell what time has passed. The glow disappeared once they entered the forest.
- According to Juniper, the party should have reached the other side of the island by now. However, there hasn’t been a discernible change in the environment. The path has been closing behind them, and the only way is forward. Vines, ferns, bushes and tropical plants coat the forest floor. Suddenly rain begins to pour down from the canopy above. As the rain falls, the path begins to turn into a muddy mess. It becomes hard to see and the group begins to grow tired. They proceed a little bit further.
- In the clearing, they decide to take a break and long rest. Ga’an prays to Lukou and Shango and Adelaide casts tiny hut. Juniper casts speak with animals and has a conversation with Stoga.
- Adelaide and Isilee have a heart-to-heart during the first watch about Isilee's difficult past. Juniper wakes up and Isilee goes to bed. Juniper and Adelaide make awkward small talk and then sit in silence.
- When Ga’an wakes up for his watch, there is a mysterious mist that emanates from the darkness as the rain ceases. Magic tries to affect Ga’ans mind, but he doesn’t succumb. The faint light dispels the tiny hut, and then Ga’an decides to follow the light. It is familiar.
  - Ga’an follows the light and suddenly isn’t in First Home anymore. He is on a beach near Senjin Village with a ruined hut. There is an old hunched troll with two fingers at the hut: Mozo're.
  - As they speak, Mozo’re is drawing voodoo and loa symbols in the sand. He explains to the young Ga'an that a Witch Doctor's purpose is to maintain the balance of the loa. Most trolls only focus on a singular loa. Witch doctors know that there are many loa, found in many places. They don’t focus on just one or two. They focus on all of them, even the unnamed ones.
  - Ga’ans father appears advises him to not go to Mozo’re for guidance, instead to seek out Gad’rin.
- The whole group wakes up at once, and somehow Ga’an has arrived back. They wake up and see that there is a long tall lanky humanoid figure with a knife in one hand and a small wooden branch in the other. It is dressed in a simple loincloth and has small shin wraps that are blue/green. It has a bunch of cords and necklaces around it’s neck. It has deep dark pink hair. It’s hair is many long braids down it’s back. It’s a troll. His name is Igor ("eye-gor")
- Igor is a Tom Bombadill esque fellow and guides the party through a series of eye based riddles, until he points the party towards where he says their destination is directly ahead. Ga’an gives him the green and purple robes from ragefire.
  - As Igor walks away, he flashes and turns into a wisp. He is a spirit!
- In the clearing, there are two large braziers, and the remnants of a large stone building. It ascends 20 ft before it is lost in the canopy. On either end of the walls, there are two immense stone statues of troll heads. These carvings are adorned in intricate details and carvings.
- Isilee checks for traps, sees none and Ga’an moves forward to inspect the carvings. He sees many pictographs, decorative shapes, and troll figures in ceremonial garb offering food in a circle. Coiled serpents in other areas on the wall.
- Ga’an tells the group about the Loa and warns Alyrin about Samedi.
- Inside the building is a large room with a raised central dais and five platforms. There is a small shelf in the back of the room with some items. There are also carvings on the walls.
- Ga’an realizes that the room is likely some sort of temple to Dambala. They all leave offerings to Dambala in front of the shrine before stepping onto the raised dais platforms. A cylinder spins up to the top of the room with a concealed staircase inside.
- Isilee checks the staircase for traps, and the group follows her up
- They make it into another room and use magic to activate pillars. This gives them access to two levers which Alyrin and Juniper pull. That gives them a brick climbing route to the ceiling to a new room and Ga’an and Isilee proceed through there.
- Ga’an and Isilee stab a poised blade into a slot in the ground. That opens a door at the end of the hall. Ga’an proceeds through the door and steps onto a raised dais.
- Suddenly, cutscene. Lots of treasures are shown to Ga’an, and Dambala says all it will take to gain the treasures is the betrayal of everyone else. Ga'an has an absolutely metal line about "if I betray my friends, will my mother walk to me, or run away?"
- The group joins up and continues forward until they arrive back in the jungle. In the shadows of the forest, we begin to see odd shapes, stone carvings. They find another clearing, full of carvings on stone walls and many braziers. The carvings are murals depicting the history of the trolls.

- Adelaide is bodied by a tree. Juniper goes beserk from the Axe of Shirvallah.
  - The party is forced to subdue her until Alyrin can break the curse
- A voice emanates from the area and a wisp appears. Ga’an believes it’s Shirvallah, and during the conversation, they discuss how the journey has just begun.
- Isilee's name is revealed by the wisp to be Anidori.
- The wisp comes back from around the corner, and has revealed itself to be Mozo’re, who is actually Gonk! He tells the party that while the world will try to pull them apart, they must stick together as a pack.
- Gonk refers to the tree person as a lost one, which implies it was a failed witch doctor
- A tunnel opens up to the west and the pack walks through. They enter a clearing (bowl shaped depression) down the path and see the area full of flickering lights and piles of skulls. A light is emanating from the stone structure at the center of the clearing. This light isn’t flickering. There are spots of almost pure white light, purplish light and sickly green light.
- There is a hole in the canopy directly above the stone structure. You’d have to stand inside the stone structure to see out of the hole.
- Ga’an walks over to the altar/temple thing in the center and inspects the area. It looks to be 10 stele, each to a loa. All of the things that have been sacrificed to the Loa during our quest are resting in the basins near the altars.
- The group looks up and sees a purple aurora borealis blasting upwards into the sky. No one has seen anything like it. All planes sit between void and light, and the connection is the twisting nether. First home is a thinning of the veil, and is the easiest place for powerful entities to move between the emerald dream and the material plane. The party is looking into the twisting nether.
- The group travels around the circle and leaves offerings to each loa (balancing them). After the loa achieve balance, vines sweep aside from an exit.
- Before they leave, Ga’an returns to the obelisk and looks up. An irradiance was shown on the tip of the obelisk, but there is no discernible difference.
- Ga’an ask Isi why she was going by another name, not Anidori. She claims that she changed her name to run away from trouble. Adelaide asked what trouble happened/what the trouble. “I basically betrayed everybody I knew”. She made a lot of conflicting promises, such as pledging herself to people. It all came to a head when she told Pietro, and then it quickly got out. She thinks he might have betrayed her. She claims it was only two organizations, and Ga’an thoroughly believes her (27 insight). Pietro worked for one of the organizations, so that might have been a factor in the betrayal. Ga’an asked what she expected to get out of all the pledges and such. She claimed that it was because she was trying to survive, and once she pledged to one group she couldn’t get out of that without pledging to another.
  - The first organization was the Blades of the Sun (high elven spy organization).
- As the group gets up and begins to head towards the tunnel, the group walks further into the trees. They see a flickering light up ahead and the group walks out of the forest into a clearing with a dilapidated hut. This is the hut from Ga’ans vision.

- Back at the Broken Keel Tavern, The party learns that Alyrin died at the Battle of Mount Hyjal and woke up possessed.
- In the back of the tavern, the party sees a beige giant putting up a poster that reads "Gladiators Wanted" for the Diremaul Gladiator Fights in Feralas.
- The party decided not to follow that particular plot hook because it was in the opposite direction of Orgrimmar and also they were almost sold into slavery AS gladiators, awkward.
- Instead, they decided to go to Orgrimmar on Captain Brightsun's boat, each PC for their own personal reasons
- Before embarking, the group met a Tauren named Sugorim. The Tauren had a crate of hides which they needed to deliver to the Hall of the Brave in the Valley of Honor.

- The session begins at a wooden hut that is an exact replica of Ga'an's childhood hut. Two tiki torches light the steps to the door, but nothing can be seen by the inside.
  - Ga'an approaches the hut and disappears into the darkness. Isilee attempts to follow after, but instead finds herself feeling around blindly in the dark. She reappears at the other side of the clearing.
- While Alyrin investigates the outside of the hut, Isilee hears a rustling sound behind her. Turning around, she sees the treeline open up into a tunnel. No one else can see it, and Isilee appears to be in a trance as she walked towards it
  - Isilee hears the sounds of the city streets of Lordaeron and the gentle strumming of a lute coming from the tunnel. A young male voice she recognizes speaks to unseen strangers, announcing he would play a song of lost love.
- As Isilee walks towards the tunnel, Adelaide attempts to call to her and pull her back, but is unsuccessful.
  - Adelaide attempts to follow after, and instead finds herself back in the same clearing
  - After some fruitless searching, Adelaide, Alyrin, and Juniper decide to sit back-to-back-to-back to keep watch.
- Meanwhile, the illusion turns on Isilee. She plummets into a freefall, only to find herself caught in a net.
  - A sourceless voice calls out: "Little moth, caught in my web, drawn to the flame. I've been watching you and your friends for sometime. What is it you seek, little moth?"
- The voice comes from the form of a 30 ft long spider with spiked legs.
  - This is Elortha no Shadra, the Mistress of Spies.
  - Her mandibles move as she speaks, but the sound emanates from all around.
  - "Your skills of subtlety and subterfuge are lacking, aren't they Anidori? The man you once loved hunting you down…poor little insect, caught in a web of your own lies"
- Shadra explains that Isilee crossed her path by chance, because of the dark contracts Ga'an made with Shadra's kin
- Isilee seeks for the loa to aid the party against the Old Gods
  - Shadra explains that the loa are bound to their plane, and only in some areas can they cross over the boundary. She can only aid indirectly
  - Shadra asks Isi what she would ask of the Mistress of Spies. Isi requests a favor from the goddess. She finds herself freed from the web, but wracked with pain and stumbling to catch herself.
- Isi walks out of the treeline grabbing at her neck. Adelaide notices a black mark in the shape of a black widow spider about the size of a gold piece that has been branded into her skin. This mark is the Blessing of the Silk Dancer.
  - The Blessing of the Silk Dancer grants Isi +2 to poison DCs as well as knowledge of 4 new poisons.
  - Isi's first words: "I THINK SHE MADE ME INTO A SPIDER"
- Ga'an finds himself in a hut with one of the four walls missing and nothing inside except a table, two chairs, a single lit candle, and ruined wall decorations. After Ga'an takes a seat, the shadows coalesce into another figure in the second chair. Ga'an recognizes from his greyish-blue pallid skin, rushka mask, burning blue eyes, and black hair that he is Bwonsamdi
  - Ga'an and Bwonsamdi speak of the history of the Darkspear trolls, constantly being forced to leave their homes and flee to another
  - Bwonsamdi refers to Ga'an as the "chosen one". Ga'an asks why the loa are so invested in the Darkspear trolls. Bwonsamdi responds that there is a lot of history yet to be written, and that Ga'an is not the only chosen one. He is not the first, and may not be the last.
- Bwonsamdi discusses the relationship between gods and their followers– worship gives the gods power to protect their followers so that they continue to worship them.
  - The gods have been around since before the trolls and will be around for a long time after. Who will they be without worshippers?
  - Gonk sees something special in Ga'an, keeps telling the rest of the loa. Ga'an came knocking on Bwonsamdi's door twice.
- Bwonsamdi states that while he would have chosen Ga'an's brother over him, he is beginning to see the same promise that Gonk sees in Ga'an.
  - He informs Ga'an that Zalazane is the chosen of another loa. He's pacted with Ueetay no Mueh'zala, which explains how Zalazane was able to raise trolls from the dead.
- Bwonsamdi reminds Ga'an–"Don't forget, we made two deals. Don't worry about the second. I'll let you know when the time comes"
- Ga'an has learned that "whatever it takes" is not the best path
  - Dambala would have offered him the power to strike down Zalazane, but where would it have left him? Ga'an didn't need him, he has his companions to help him weather the challenges ahead.
  - Bwonsamdi reminds Ga'an that many trolls, with and without friends have tried to take on Zalazane but no one has come back. How is he different?
- Ga'an responds that he and his friends have made it to first home, under the ocean.
- Bwonsamdi asks, "Why are you and your people in the situation you've been in now?"
  - He answers his own question: "Friendship. You aren't the only group to be carved into the blank wall. You are not the first, but you will be the last if you mess up. Before you, it was another troll, one blind to the truth, too weak to take action and protect the people he leads now. How many have suffered for this choice? All for friendship. One troll knew what needed to be done but chose not to. "
  - Bwonsamdi additionally provides guidance on the Zalazane problem– by removing the Farraki worshippers, Zalazane will become weaker, as he receives power from the god of the Farraki.
- The conversation comes to a close and Ga'an leaves the hut. A moth-like creature lands on his head.
  - The creature has broad brown wings patterned with eyes, and a skull on its thorax.
  - He receives the Champion of the Grave blessing, which allows him to re-roll a death saving throw once per day.
- Isi wants a souvenir of the house to take with her, she finds a splinter to pull
- The group exits the clearing through a tunnel that forms in the treeline and makes their way back to the beach. When they reach it, they notice crystal torches like a star field and new structures outside the dome that were not there before.
- Adelaide casts Tiny Hut to blend in with trees, makes goodberries cool ranch flavors.
- Adelaide and Isi have a heart to heart on their watch together. They discuss Isi's experience with the spider goddess and Isi's fears about betraying the group given her history. They also discuss the gem Adelaide found in the Academy ruins that she felt a terrifying draw to; Isi takes it from her.
- The party makes its way out of First Home and starts to proceed out of the dome. Ga'an, Juniper, and Adelaide notice what appears to be a watch of two Naga circling outside the dome passing by every 10-20 minutes.
- The party passes through the dome and splits up to hide behind rocks. They come to the realization that there has been a war camp erected to watch them as they made their way through the First Home dome.
- In the camp are four sharks with saddles that are tied to a mast, as well as a statue of the Naga sorceress Zar'jira, depicting her snakelike body, snake hair, and royal garments.
- About to be spotted by enemy patrols, Alyrin makes Juniper and herself invisible as they advance through the camp. The party debate on riding the sharks, but Ga'an feels it is not a good idea. Instead, Ga'an uses a shadow mastiff to free one of the sharks seen tied up in the Naga camp as a distraction.
- The party is spotted by the Naga on watch, who sounds an alarm. The alarm catches the attention of the sea witch, who rises to meet the group.
- After defeating the faceless one, the voidwalker it summoned, and the naga witch, the party noticed swarms of light moving in their direction. The party fled down the wall and into the naga slums, trying to shake their pursuers…

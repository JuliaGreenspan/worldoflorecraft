- The party convene on deck to discuss the plan. Lu'va is sent to scout and discovers that Dazduga volcano is between the ship and the center of the whirlpool. The volcano is immense and dotted with structures at its base. There seems to be a shelf on the seafloor with a multitude of dilapidated stone structures. Traveling further, she then comes across structures built of different materials, as well as shattered boats similar in design to those in Sen'jin. Further in are mounds and buildings similar to islands, and a very intact stone structure.
- Trolls historically do not build with stone, so Lu'va's findings are puzzling to the party.
- Before they depart, A'thien tells the party of his sister, Go'ze, who was once an aspiring Witch Doctor who traveled to First Home. He asks that the group please pay Go'ze the proper respects.
  - Note: this was forgotten about immediately and we absolutely did not do this
- The party dives into the ocean and begins to explore the stone city. The area is largely leveled and destroyed. Adelaide and Alyrin identify that the architecture of these ruins appears to be Night Elven, prior to the separation of the High Elves and Night Elves. This was long ago before the Sundering, when the world was one continent. The city may have sunken during the Sundering, when the world split.
  - Adelaide is geeking out about this
- The party comes across a troll ship that likely came from when the trolls were fleeing the island. Inside is several troll corpses; a family that never escaped.
- Further on, whispers in Elven start to permeate the area, reliving the last moments of the city. The Gaytekeepërs approach the intact building, and start to notice iconography of Elune. The sound of crying starts to stand out. It is near the building that looks like it could be a Temple to Elune.
- The crying is coming from the ghost of a Night Elven child named Thalia. She is upset that she can't pick up her doll. She says that her mother, a priestess, is angry at her. She last saw her mother in the mausoleum.
- The party agree to seek out her mother and journey into the mausoleum. Inside it is a statue of a female elf looking upward towards the sky. In her hand is a large diamond. Unlike the other statues, there is no damage
- The party fight a banshee and some will o'wisps, and struggle to solve a elementary school level riddle but finally achieve success. In reward, they are granted a pearl of power and a large diamond.
- Thalia is reunited with her mother and their souls are at last set free to find their final resting place.

- Ga’an leads the party forward while Isilee looks for treasure.
- As they are traveling, Ga’an sees a patch of seaweed that is razor sharp, but they are able to avoid the seaweed.
- Alyrin thinks she is hallucinating the buildings intact, and experiences flashbacks to when she was a child prior to the sundering.
- A chill starts to crawl down the backs of everyone's spines. As the team proceeds through a new section of the ruins, they come across the base of a tower. Alyrin sees a flash of light before it dwindles away.
- The party is ambushed by undead ghosty things. Ga’an drinks their souls.
- The group proceedes forward. As they approach Dazduga mountain, the volcanic activity picks up. Ga’an barely keeps Alyrin from jumping into a volcanic vent.
- Ga’an meditates during a short rest at the base of the shelf. As he focused in on the feeling of the purple mark that had been on his chest, Ga’an finds himself within his own mind in silence. He opens his eyes and finds himself in a familiar dark space. As he looks around, he realizes that he is spalshing around in knee deep water. Illuminating the space is the blue light of the distant moon. He can’t see further than 5 feet around himself. In the distance he sees 2 beacons, that rapidly turns to 3 beacons, then 4. As he steps towards the beacons, it looks as if 3 are clustered together and 1 is separate, further away.
- They proceed to swim forward and begin approaching the volcano. As they travel towards what was left of Dazduga shrine, they begin to see creatures swimming around, humaoid creatures with legs, but fish-like features. They keep having to duck into rock crevices to hide away. The creatures have pale green skin, crusted with barnacles. Some have tentacles, various aquatic fishlike features. They all look different. Some have humanoid features, some look troll like, or human like features. Some have elven features. They occasionally speak a language but nothing that the party recognizes.
- Isilee stealths ahead to peak over the wall of the temple. She sees massive fissures, filled with lava, pouring out into the ocean. She sees a few figures at the shrine, marching up to the lava pool. As they move to the lava, one seems to stay back. This one seems to have 4 arms. She speaks words praising Ragnaros, and the old gods, and asking them to bestow power upon them. The other 3 individuals dunk themselves in the lava
- Adelaide remembers that Ragnaros is the elemental lord of fire, enslaved by the old gods
- A fight ensues. In the aftermath, Ga dissects the fire Naga. The Naga's skin has a magmatic sheen, and his heart has a magmatic essence. Sort of like an elemental fire mixed with biological tissue. Ga’an wants to offer the heart to Krag’wa.

- Ga’an leads the party to his family's former home of Zul’dara. At the island, and as they approach they see glowing purple lights, not Loa vibes and not undead vibes. They hide behind a tree to avoid a patrol and proceed forward. A sort of mosslike growth seems to be collecting on the trees. Ga’an tries to collect some, and is badly injured by a frostbite/freezing cold from the moss.
- The party draws closer to the village and realize that the purple lights are crystals, and people are still living in the village (just not trolls).
- They proceed south through the forest to the area where Ga’ans home once was. Upon arriving in the clearing, the coast is clear and Ga’an enters into the remnants of his hut. Memories flash before his eyes and he is brought back to the old days.
- He begins by looking through the ritual masks, tattered, broken and bleached by time and the sea. Much of the paints are weathered off. Something catches his eye: a small white shape buried amongst the rubble. He pulls out a small ornate knife that has been carved from bone, barely larger than Ga’ans finger. A small crack runs down the sheath, brittle from the ocean. The knife is as sharp as Ga’an remembers.
  - A memory flashes through his mind. His first hunt, the knife carved from the tooth of his father’s first trophy kill. Ga’an was never meant to lose it, but it couldn’t be retrieved before boarding the ship.
- The others can’t find anything of interest searching the house, but Ga’an finds a piece of wood from the home that is still mostly intact.
- They proceed towards the Temple of the Loa. As they pass towards the temple they find piranha-esque fish but Ga’an is able to chart a path around them.
- As they approach the temple, the party sees the large stone wall with a huge tower, where the whirlpool originates. Ga’an notices those similar purple lights as they bob along the walls.
- Eventually they arrive at the temple, an immense Ziggurat-like structure. Many of the carvings have been damaged by the sea and destroyed. Sections of the temple seem to be caved in and destroyed. For the most part, it is the decorations are what has been damaged.
- Ga’an remembers coming here on market days with his father to sell hunting goods. There were many tiers to the temple, and different people went to different areas for different needs.
- Down the staircase is a ruined relief of a witch doctor traversing first home. This was once a place where acolytes and priests lived. Walls are caked in algae like growth.
- The furthest southern room (kitchen) is destroyed and caved in. Spots in the stonework are uncovered and glossy on the walls.
- SNAIL FIGHT

- Adelaide casts tiny hut and all take a long rest
- As Ga’an falls asleep, he finds himself in the endless black void.
  - It feels as if an eternity passes, wading through knee deep water. Echos reverberate out from the splashing. No light permeates the area, and Ga’an can barely see his hands in front of his face. Suddenly, when he turns around he can see a beachfront, and Ga’an is knee deep in the surf. As he walks forward onto the beach front, he sees a thick, dense forest. As he approaches, the trees move out of the way. Ga’an strides forward, following the path laid out by the trees. As he walks forward, the trees close in behind him. There is no way but forward. There is a cacophony of sound, birds, insects. Eventually the path empties out into a clearing. In the clearing is a hut, the hut from Ga’ans childhood. But this hut is pristine. It looks as if the day they fled the islands. Ga’an is reminded of the attack from Zalazane, fleeing his home for the second time. The interior of the hut is pitch black. Ga’an opens the door and enters. However, the door slams shut behind him, and he is once more in the endless void. Behind Ga’an is a table with a single lit candle. A chair is pulled out beckoning him to sit.
  - Ga’an sits down, and Bwonsamdi sits before him. Ga’an talks to Bwonsamdi, and it is implied that Bwonsamdi wants results, sooner rather than later.
- Meanwhile, the rest of the party shares a different dreaM;
  - They find themselves swimming in a black void. They can't stop, if they stop, they will die. They can see the silhouettes of dead humanoids floating all around, hundreds of bodies. A deep voice says "Let go". The voice comes from a small fish. "We have not forgotten, we have not forgiven. I have tasted every one of your powers; you are nothing. I AM A GOD."
- The party awaken and divide the snail shell into:
  - 4 Breastplate sized pieces
  - 7 dish plate sized pieces
  - 2 Ga’an's palm sized pieces
- The party is ambushed by some fish people. They kill them and proceed forward.
- Ga’an enters the next room, and sees glowing purple lights and ruins. A dais has a large cauldron and blue glowing runes. At a rickety table, Ga’an sees a table with a non moving humanoid shape sitting at the table.
- There are people in the room. Three human women, one of them an old lady. All are bound and dressed in tattered rags. They claim to be sailors sailing from Stormwind to Theramoore, caught in the whirlpool. Adelaide casts Dispel Magic and the old lady is revealed to be a sea hag.
- A grueling fight commences, with a brief pause to plead for mercy. Ga'an refuses to offer his knife as a tribute, though Isilee offers a necklace the party has not seen before and tries to negotiate a deal that will require a contract signed in blood. The fight begins again and the team is (barely) triumphant, TPK avoided.

- The party investigates the Hag's room. Isilee finds a boatload of biological things, teeth, claws, eyes, bits, etc… Box o’Organs
- Ga’an inspects the body on the table, split open as if it was being dissected. Most of the organs have been removed. Some other things have been added, inhuman organs that Ga’an doesn’t necessarily recognize. Possibly human, but hard to be certain. Some of the skin has been removed and fish scales placed on these spots. The magic is a very old magic that Adelaid has never dealt with.
- Isilee confronts Ga’an about his refusal to give the witch the bone dagger.
- Isilee scouts ahead to the south, and finds a collapsed hallway they can squeeze through. They follow her through the door.
- They explore the center room, and don’t really find anything. The staircases going to the lower level are filled in with sand and rubble. It appears they are inaccessible.
- They look in the storage room to the southeast, and after a brief fight with the mephits, investigate the storeroom. They find 600 gold, 600 silver, 900 copper, ruined robes and vestments destroyed by the sea, and ruined ritual items, fetishes and masks. There is also an opaque white stone and an opaque crimson stone, translucent dark green stone, translucent rich gold stone (opaque and smooth to the touch), translucent stone with circles of grey white and green, other stones, 2 bottles (still corked) one has a thick red viscous liquid, and the other has a blue liquid with a silvery shimmer. A small pouch with 3 knuckle bones, one side has a happy face and the other has a sad face. The last item is a golden shimmering chain, with 5 reddish orange spherical gems.
- Finally, they come across an ornate light balanced decorative hand axe, covered in tribal markings. There appears to be tigers claws on one side. This is a +1 finesse hand axe of Shirvala.
- Investigation of the Seance room finds piles of bones and pieces of creatures littering the floor. Also piles of coin are present: 2300 copper, 1700 silver, 40 gold, we find a bottle containing a thick red liquid with a silvery color. There is also a necklace of five fireball beads which the party splits so everyone has one.
- Ga’an has a recollection of the banner, he remembers the day they fled the island. It started with a human attack from Kul’Tiras, and the banner looks similar to the Kul’Tiran ships and sails. First strangers came to the island, these people were the orcs, fleeing from the eastern kingdoms. They were welcomed with open arms. A week later, human ships - the Kul’Tiras attacked. They first attacked the troll outpost, and then spread to attacking trolls. A few days after that the sea witch sank the island.
- Ga'an walks the party through the proper rituals, and Ga’an leaves the rib bone of the demon enforcer for Samedi. Isilee prays to Shadra, and leaves a mirror. Juniper prayed to Shirvallah.
- Climbing to the top of the temple, they destroy a Naga statue at the top and complete the rituals to Gonk and Bwonsamedi. Ga'an gives Gonk the heart of Ragnaros’s chosen.
- The party ventures on from the Temple to the Tomb of the Old Ones, encountering a Ley Line dead spot along the way where magic is dissipated. They map its boundaries and avoid it.
- The left side of the Tomb is collapsed, but the right side is intact. Ga’an discovers the tomb of the high priest Jeram, whose mask was oddly intact and able to be reached. Ga’an recalls that Jeram was the high priest, well respected. He was referred to as the chosen of Samedi. He died shortly before Ga’an was born.
- Ga’an takes the mask and puts it on. He hears a whisper, "Make the darkspear proud".

- Everyone but Juniper has a shared dream/vision, the same as the night before. They are sinking in a deep ocean, slowly following. As they tire, they fall to the depths. As they struggle trying to keep from sinking away. There is a voice telling them to let go. A small fish is circling their heads
  - Ga’an declares him false and declares that Gral is the true lord of the sea. This angers the creature, who responds "I am the original, I was here before your gods. I will be here after. The Black Empire is very real, long before all were the Old Gods". "Buried deep beneath the earth is a power. The chains will break soon and I will destroy each and every one of you.
  - The vortex is their doom.
- The party discuss their shared dreams in the morning. Adelaide explains that Void is antithesis of light - the opposite of those who draw upon the light. The capital "T" Theory behind this is that there are dimensions that are behind/beyond our own. Light and void have never been traversed as far as mortals are concerned. The dimensions meet in a place of chaos, the twisting nether. It is believed that this can cause things to be created that are otherwise not meant to exist. Reality, demons, etc. spawn from the Void. It is believed that the ancient physical beings that ruled Azeroth were Void incarnate. For something to manifest from the void, it must be immensely powerful. A tenet of the void is that there is infinite possibility.
- Juniper had a spooky not fish dream. She was in Thunderbluff, prior to Thunderbluff's existance. Her parents eyes were melting and had tentacles and said they would never leave. Today is the first fay of Wintervale, a feast celebrating that the world has renewed again, an important day in Tauren culture
- The group stealths to the gate with no issues. Ga’an observes that the ground dips drastically there and that there were many small cramped hovels made of ruined stone and driftwood. The area is full of activity and there are many narrow streets. They are occupied by all the small fish folk (mrglefolk/murlocs) like the Gaytekeepërs saw with the Naga. There is also a large plateau with coral structures. This plateau has buildings/structures made of stone.
- The group decides to stealth through the slums to the southernmost gate. The idea is to sneak through and circle around southwest around the plateau.
- As they are stealthing, Isilee ends up finding a murloc and knifes him to death. They continue stealthing and they find a main throughfair. On the main road, there is a Naga. two mur’guls, a sea spawn and a weird lobster centaur creature.
- The party run across the road into an abandoned house. Alyrin uses invisibility to scout ahead, and finds a path forward. As they run forward, Isilee assassinates one murloc who was just minding his business working on his carving. Then another murloc ran around the corner, and got instantly knifed by Isilee. The Gaytekeepërs sprint to the edge of town and make it out without being seen.
- After exiting the gate, they notice multiple large fancy ruined buildings, which the party at first decide not to investigage. Adelaide has a change of heart and does a quick swim-through of the building with detect magic active. She borrows Isilee’s ring for this. She uncovers a magic box and a gem that seems to pull her in (but she resists it).
- The party proceedes toward First Home and sees that it is surrounded in stone walls.
- Isilee stealths to the top of the wall but rolled poorly on her perception check. Roll initiative.
- The party kills a naga and some murlocs, then books it down to First Home, which seems to be encased in a snowglobe-esque bubble that the Naga cannot enter.
- Adelaide tries to send a message to A'thian letting him know that the party made it to First Home. The message back is barely audible. This indicates that the Gaytekeepërs have entered another plane of existance.
- Ga'an prays to the loa, and a light starts to radiate from his chest. As he looks up, the trees start to move and shift to reveal a path.

- More Naga have gathered around the bubble of First Home. Isilee takes a quick break to investigate the box that Adelaide discovered and try to open it. She notices that there is a very powerful magical trap and is unsure what it does.
- Adelaide decides to hold off on doing anything with it since the spell protecting it is very high level and will probably TPK them. Isilee gathers sand.
- The party enters into the forests of First Home. It is dark, and very difficult to see. When they look up, all they can see is thick jungle canopy. Juniper opens her dagger. While at first, there is no breeze or noise, the party slowly becomes aware of insect sounds and the occasional bird call. Ga’an is in front leading the group deeper into the forest. There is no way to tell what time has passed. The glow disappeared once they entered the forest.
- According to Juniper, the party should have reached the other side of the island by now. However, there hasn’t been a discernible change in the environment. The path has been closing behind them, and the only way is forward. Vines, ferns, bushes and tropical plants coat the forest floor. Suddenly rain begins to pour down from the canopy above. As the rain falls, the path begins to turn into a muddy mess. It becomes hard to see and the group begins to grow tired. They proceed a little bit further.
- In the clearing, they decide to take a break and long rest. Ga’an prays to Lukou and Shango and Adelaide casts tiny hut. Juniper casts speak with animals and has a conversation with Stoga.
- Adelaide and Isilee have a heart-to-heart during the first watch about Isilee's difficult past. Juniper wakes up and Isilee goes to bed. Juniper and Adelaide make awkward small talk and then sit in silence.
- When Ga’an wakes up for his watch, there is a mysterious mist that emanates from the darkness as the rain ceases. Magic tries to affect Ga’ans mind, but he doesn’t succumb. The faint light dispels the tiny hut, and then Ga’an decides to follow the light. It is familiar.
  - Ga’an follows the light and suddenly isn’t in First Home anymore. He is on a beach near Senjin Village with a ruined hut. There is an old hunched troll with two fingers at the hut: Mozo're.
  - As they speak, Mozo’re is drawing voodoo and loa symbols in the sand. He explains to the young Ga'an that a Witch Doctor's purpose is to maintain the balance of the loa. Most trolls only focus on a singular loa. Witch doctors know that there are many loa, found in many places. They don’t focus on just one or two. They focus on all of them, even the unnamed ones.
  - Ga’ans father appears advises him to not go to Mozo’re for guidance, instead to seek out Gad’rin.
- The whole group wakes up at once, and somehow Ga’an has arrived back. They wake up and see that there is a long tall lanky humanoid figure with a knife in one hand and a small wooden branch in the other. It is dressed in a simple loincloth and has small shin wraps that are blue/green. It has a bunch of cords and necklaces around it’s neck. It has deep dark pink hair. It’s hair is many long braids down it’s back. It’s a troll. His name is Igor ("eye-gor")
- Igor is a Tom Bombadill esque fellow and guides the party through a series of eye based riddles, until he points the party towards where he says their destination is directly ahead. Ga’an gives him the green and purple robes from ragefire.
  - As Igor walks away, he flashes and turns into a wisp. He is a spirit!
- In the clearing, there are two large braziers, and the remnants of a large stone building. It ascends 20 ft before it is lost in the canopy. On either end of the walls, there are two immense stone statues of troll heads. These carvings are adorned in intricate details and carvings.
- Isilee checks for traps, sees none and Ga’an moves forward to inspect the carvings. He sees many pictographs, decorative shapes, and troll figures in ceremonial garb offering food in a circle. Coiled serpents in other areas on the wall.
- Ga’an tells the group about the Loa and warns Alyrin about Samedi.
- Inside the building is a large room with a raised central dais and five platforms. There is a small shelf in the back of the room with some items. There are also carvings on the walls.
- Ga’an realizes that the room is likely some sort of temple to Dambala. They all leave offerings to Dambala in front of the shrine before stepping onto the raised dais platforms. A cylinder spins up to the top of the room with a concealed staircase inside.
- Isilee checks the staircase for traps, and the group follows her up
- They make it into another room and use magic to activate pillars. This gives them access to two levers which Alyrin and Juniper pull. That gives them a brick climbing route to the ceiling to a new room and Ga’an and Isilee proceed through there.
- Ga’an and Isilee stab a poised blade into a slot in the ground. That opens a door at the end of the hall. Ga’an proceeds through the door and steps onto a raised dais.
- Suddenly, cutscene. Lots of treasures are shown to Ga’an, and Dambala says all it will take to gain the treasures is the betrayal of everyone else. Ga'an has an absolutely metal line about "if I betray my friends, will my mother walk to me, or run away?"
- The group joins up and continues forward until they arrive back in the jungle. In the shadows of the forest, we begin to see odd shapes, stone carvings. They find another clearing, full of carvings on stone walls and many braziers. The carvings are murals depicting the history of the trolls.

- Adelaide is bodied by a tree. Juniper goes beserk from the Axe of Shirvallah.
  - The party is forced to subdue her until Alyrin can break the curse
- A voice emanates from the area and a wisp appears. Ga’an believes it’s Shirvallah, and during the conversation, they discuss how the journey has just begun.
- Isilee's name is revealed by the wisp to be Anidori.
- The wisp comes back from around the corner, and has revealed itself to be Mozo’re, who is actually Gonk! He tells the party that while the world will try to pull them apart, they must stick together as a pack.
- Gonk refers to the tree person as a lost one, which implies it was a failed witch doctor
- A tunnel opens up to the west and the pack walks through. They enter a clearing (bowl shaped depression) down the path and see the area full of flickering lights and piles of skulls. A light is emanating from the stone structure at the center of the clearing. This light isn’t flickering. There are spots of almost pure white light, purplish light and sickly green light.
- There is a hole in the canopy directly above the stone structure. You’d have to stand inside the stone structure to see out of the hole.
- Ga’an walks over to the altar/temple thing in the center and inspects the area. It looks to be 10 stele, each to a loa. All of the things that have been sacrificed to the Loa during our quest are resting in the basins near the altars.
- The group looks up and sees a purple aurora borealis blasting upwards into the sky. No one has seen anything like it. All planes sit between void and light, and the connection is the twisting nether. First home is a thinning of the veil, and is the easiest place for powerful entities to move between the emerald dream and the material plane. The party is looking into the twisting nether.
- The group travels around the circle and leaves offerings to each loa (balancing them). After the loa achieve balance, vines sweep aside from an exit.
- Before they leave, Ga’an returns to the obelisk and looks up. An irradiance was shown on the tip of the obelisk, but there is no discernible difference.
- Ga’an ask Isi why she was going by another name, not Anidori. She claims that she changed her name to run away from trouble. Adelaide asked what trouble happened/what the trouble. “I basically betrayed everybody I knew”. She made a lot of conflicting promises, such as pledging herself to people. It all came to a head when she told Pietro, and then it quickly got out. She thinks he might have betrayed her. She claims it was only two organizations, and Ga’an thoroughly believes her (27 insight). Pietro worked for one of the organizations, so that might have been a factor in the betrayal. Ga’an asked what she expected to get out of all the pledges and such. She claimed that it was because she was trying to survive, and once she pledged to one group she couldn’t get out of that without pledging to another.
  - The first organization was the Blades of the Sun (high elven spy organization).
- As the group gets up and begins to head towards the tunnel, the group walks further into the trees. They see a flickering light up ahead and the group walks out of the forest into a clearing with a dilapidated hut. This is the hut from Ga’ans vision.

- Now back in Ratchet, the party goes to Jazzick's to get supplies.
- Back at the Broken Keel Tavern, The party learns that Alyrin died at the Battle of Mount Hyjal and woke up possessed.
- In the back of the tavern, the party sees a beige giant putting up a poster that reads "Gladiators Wanted" for the Diremaul Gladiator Fights in Feralas.
- The party decided not to follow that particular plot hook because it was in the opposite direction of Orgrimmar and also they were almost sold into slavery AS gladiators, awkward.
- Instead, they decided to go to Orgrimmar on Captain Brightsun's boat, each PC for their own personal reasons
- Before embarking, the group met a Tauren named Sugorim. The Tauren had a crate of hides which they needed to deliver to the Hall of the Brave in the Valley of Honor.

- The session begins at a wooden hut that is an exact replica of Ga'an's childhood hut. Two tiki torches light the steps to the door, but nothing can be seen by the inside.
  - Ga'an approaches the hut and disappears into the darkness. Isilee attempts to follow after, but instead finds herself feeling around blindly in the dark. She reappears at the other side of the clearing.
- While Alyrin investigates the outside of the hut, Isilee hears a rustling sound behind her. Turning around, she sees the treeline open up into a tunnel. No one else can see it, and Isilee appears to be in a trance as she walked towards it
  - Isilee hears the sounds of the city streets of Lordaeron and the gentle strumming of a lute coming from the tunnel. A young male voice she recognizes speaks to unseen strangers, announcing he would play a song of lost love.
- As Isilee walks towards the tunnel, Adelaide attempts to call to her and pull her back, but is unsuccessful.
  - Adelaide attempts to follow after, and instead finds herself back in the same clearing
  - After some fruitless searching, Adelaide, Alyrin, and Juniper decide to sit back-to-back-to-back to keep watch.
- Meanwhile, the illusion turns on Isilee. She plummets into a freefall, only to find herself caught in a net.
  - A sourceless voice calls out: "Little moth, caught in my web, drawn to the flame. I've been watching you and your friends for sometime. What is it you seek, little moth?"
- The voice comes from the form of a 30 ft long spider with spiked legs.
  - This is Elortha no Shadra, the Mistress of Spies.
  - Her mandibles move as she speaks, but the sound emanates from all around.
  - "Your skills of subtlety and subterfuge are lacking, aren't they Anidori? The man you once loved hunting you down…poor little insect, caught in a web of your own lies"
- Shadra explains that Isilee crossed her path by chance, because of the dark contracts Ga'an made with Shadra's kin
- Isilee seeks for the loa to aid the party against the Old Gods
  - Shadra explains that the loa are bound to their plane, and only in some areas can they cross over the boundary. She can only aid indirectly
  - Shadra asks Isi what she would ask of the Mistress of Spies. Isi requests a favor from the goddess. She finds herself freed from the web, but wracked with pain and stumbling to catch herself.
- Isi walks out of the treeline grabbing at her neck. Adelaide notices a black mark in the shape of a black widow spider about the size of a gold piece that has been branded into her skin. This mark is the Blessing of the Silk Dancer.
  - The Blessing of the Silk Dancer grants Isi +2 to poison DCs as well as knowledge of 4 new poisons.
  - Isi's first words: "I THINK SHE MADE ME INTO A SPIDER"
- Ga'an finds himself in a hut with one of the four walls missing and nothing inside except a table, two chairs, a single lit candle, and ruined wall decorations. After Ga'an takes a seat, the shadows coalesce into another figure in the second chair. Ga'an recognizes from his greyish-blue pallid skin, rushka mask, burning blue eyes, and black hair that he is Bwonsamdi
  - Ga'an and Bwonsamdi speak of the history of the Darkspear trolls, constantly being forced to leave their homes and flee to another
  - Bwonsamdi refers to Ga'an as the "chosen one". Ga'an asks why the loa are so invested in the Darkspear trolls. Bwonsamdi responds that there is a lot of history yet to be written, and that Ga'an is not the only chosen one. He is not the first, and may not be the last.
- Bwonsamdi discusses the relationship between gods and their followers– worship gives the gods power to protect their followers so that they continue to worship them.
  - The gods have been around since before the trolls and will be around for a long time after. Who will they be without worshippers?
  - Gonk sees something special in Ga'an, keeps telling the rest of the loa. Ga'an came knocking on Bwonsamdi's door twice.
- Bwonsamdi states that while he would have chosen Ga'an's brother over him, he is beginning to see the same promise that Gonk sees in Ga'an.
  - He informs Ga'an that Zalazane is the chosen of another loa. He's pacted with Ueetay no Mueh'zala, which explains how Zalazane was able to raise trolls from the dead.
- Bwonsamdi reminds Ga'an–"Don't forget, we made two deals. Don't worry about the second. I'll let you know when the time comes"
- Ga'an has learned that "whatever it takes" is not the best path
  - Dambala would have offered him the power to strike down Zalazane, but where would it have left him? Ga'an didn't need him, he has his companions to help him weather the challenges ahead.
  - Bwonsamdi reminds Ga'an that many trolls, with and without friends have tried to take on Zalazane but no one has come back. How is he different?
- Ga'an responds that he and his friends have made it to first home, under the ocean.
- Bwonsamdi asks, "Why are you and your people in the situation you've been in now?"
  - He answers his own question: "Friendship. You aren't the only group to be carved into the blank wall. You are not the first, but you will be the last if you mess up. Before you, it was another troll, one blind to the truth, too weak to take action and protect the people he leads now. How many have suffered for this choice? All for friendship. One troll knew what needed to be done but chose not to. "
  - Bwonsamdi additionally provides guidance on the Zalazane problem– by removing the Farraki worshippers, Zalazane will become weaker, as he receives power from the god of the Farraki.
- The conversation comes to a close and Ga'an leaves the hut. A moth-like creature lands on his head.
  - The creature has broad brown wings patterned with eyes, and a skull on its thorax.
  - He receives the Champion of the Grave blessing, which allows him to re-roll a death saving throw once per day.
- Isi wants a souvenir of the house to take with her, she finds a splinter to pull
- The group exits the clearing through a tunnel that forms in the treeline and makes their way back to the beach. When they reach it, they notice crystal torches like a star field and new structures outside the dome that were not there before.
- Adelaide casts Tiny Hut to blend in with trees, makes goodberries cool ranch flavors.
- Adelaide and Isi have a heart to heart on their watch together. They discuss Isi's experience with the spider goddess and Isi's fears about betraying the group given her history. They also discuss the gem Adelaide found in the Academy ruins that she felt a terrifying draw to; Isi takes it from her.
- The party makes its way out of First Home and starts to proceed out of the dome. Ga'an, Juniper, and Adelaide notice what appears to be a watch of two Naga circling outside the dome passing by every 10-20 minutes.
- The party passes through the dome and splits up to hide behind rocks. They come to the realization that there has been a war camp erected to watch them as they made their way through the First Home dome.
- In the camp are four sharks with saddles that are tied to a mast, as well as a statue of the Naga sorceress Zar'jira, depicting her snakelike body, snake hair, and royal garments.
- About to be spotted by enemy patrols, Alyrin makes Juniper and herself invisible as they advance through the camp. The party debate on riding the sharks, but Ga'an feels it is not a good idea. Instead, Ga'an uses a shadow mastiff to free one of the sharks seen tied up in the Naga camp as a distraction.
- The party is spotted by the Naga on watch, who sounds an alarm. The alarm catches the attention of the sea witch, who rises to meet the group.
- After defeating the faceless one, the voidwalker it summoned, and the naga witch, the party noticed swarms of light moving in their direction. The party fled down the wall and into the naga slums, trying to shake their pursuers…

- The session begins with the party deciding to duck into an alleyway of the Mur’gul slums
- Adelaide is unsure of what the creature from last session was, but finds it reminiscent of dreams they’ve had of late
- Juniper casts Pass Without a Trace on the party
- The group is heading south east towards the ruins of Alme Nalore
- Adelaide casts Major Image to create the distraction of a Kraken going in a north west direction. The Naga spot it and blow their horns to sound the alarm.
- Isilee ducks into a hut and finds it to be occupied. She easily murders it as the rest of the party follows her inside. While Adelaide is passing through the threshold, a Mur’gul spots her and begins to yell. She dispatches it and Alyrin shoves the body into the hut.
- The party continues to move through the slums. Isi peeks into another hut, casting mute on one of the Mur’guls inside. She, Juniper, and Adelaide kill the two Mur’guls while Ga’an and Alyrin investigate an empty hut with a chest.
  - The chest holds several fish, an iridescent conch shell (which Ga’an takes), 3 GP, 2 SP
- Isi checks out another hut that is in a state of disrepair. She notices out of the corner of her eye a reddish Mur’gul with a glowing crystal staff, looking up at the Kraken illusion. Isilee casts Mute on the Mur’gul. The muted Mur’gul attempts to convey the threat to another Mur’gul, who is confused by apparent miming.
- Isilee notices a stone ziggurat with a statue on top with snake-like features. A mur’gul bows down at the altar
- Rotting corpses of adventures decorate the shrine of Zharjira as offerings
- The slums situation escalates as the illusion flickers out. More and more Mur’guls come to investigate the noise, and several Naga catch up as well as a crab/centaur creature.
- With the party low on health and mana, Adelaide grabs a barely conscious Alyrin and Dimension Doors to the edge of the slums.
- Adelaide takes out her sending stone to alert A’thian that the party is out of First Home and making their way back to the ship.
- A’thian is surprised to hear they are alive and informs them that they’ve been gone from the ship for 13 days. His message cuts off as he says, “The captain wants to-”
- Adelaide begins to cast Tiny Hut and sends Lu’va out to catch the attention of the rest of the party.
- Alyrin, unsure of what else to do, takes out the fish she grabbed from the Mur’gul chest and begins to snack.
- The rest of the party just barely manage to make it out of the slums alive, reconvening at the Tiny Hut.

- A creature swims near, long with a rounded front body, fish tail, three long tentacles and a giant, toothy maw. It appears to be an aberration, not of this plan of existence. It has three black eyes aligned vertically.
  - The creature's form shimmers and then splits into two. One goes north, while the other goes south, passing over the Tiny Hut but luckily not stopping.
- Adelaide yells at Ga’an for vetoing the rest of the group about riding the sharks.
- Isilee looks for alignment on how much to give Stormfang as his bonus
- Ga’an proposes going around and back to the ship by going east through the ruins and hugging the shelf
- Stealthing along, Alyrin hears distant moaning/wailing noises in the background, but they ignore the party.
- Two sixty foot statues of night elven figures mark the entrance to the armory
- Adelaide doesnt think its wise to go in, but Isi and Alyrin would like to. The party takes a vote. Isi, Alyrin, and Juniper want to go in which is a majority
- Inside, the structure is half crumbled, similar to the academy that Adelaide explored. On the wall, Isi recognizes the ancient high elf symbol and old darnassian (the sentinels prayer):
  - Through her light we are protected
  - [Larger blank] embrace
  - In her wrath [blank] strengthened
  - Our foes we erase
  - [Blank] death
  - Wax and wane
  - [Larger blank] we are reborn
  - Elune be with us
- Isi & Juniper find one quiver full of 20 wooden arrows, seemingly untouched, and another quiver untouched, beautiful elven design. Alyrin finds one long metal rod carved with runes, uncorroded, and two sealed ceramic jars. Ga’an notices an orb of light, a will o’ wisp traveling around, that hasn't clocked the party.
- Naga seem to avoid the ruins, though the large fish squid like creature seemed to not mind it
- Lot of purple lights floating above the party, seems like patrols have doubled
- Isi suggests looking through the academy again, but Adelaide is not in favor, the group agrees
- The party makes it back to the ship, and Adelaide casts identify on the armory loot:
  - immovable rod
  - Bundle +1 arrows, they stack with +1 bow
  - Quiver is the Quiver of Eonar, the lifebinder, nature goddess, ordering of Azeroth, titan pantheon more associated with dwarven/gnomish religion
  - Bag of holding for ammo
- Turning quiver inside out:
  - Gallons of seawater, oops
  - 40 arrows
  - One extra special arrow with green glow, gnarly tip
- The gem that Adelaide feared is an elemental mote of arcane which can summon an elemental
- Isilee makes a weird souvenir jar of teeth, sand, sea water, booze, eyeballs, fishbones as a “gift” for ga’an
- Ga’an puts on naga priestess robe with two extra arm holes
- The party travels back to Orgrimmar, nightmare free. Ga'an decides to bring the cursed Axe of Shirvalla to the Valley of Spirits.
- The team's plan is to go talk to Jes'rimmon first, then Thrall. They need to run errands in Orgrimmar, then head out to Moonglade by way of Thunderbluff
- The party is surprised by a large guard presence at the dock, and the presence of many warships. They make inquires and discover that the Horde is at war with the Alliance! There is bad fighting in Ashenvale, where the night elves are
- The party recalls that the Forsaken joined the Horde thanks to the help of the Tauren. The Forsaken were attacked by the Eastern Kingdoms, and sent emissaries seeking aide. The only emissaries they sent who weren't killed were the emissaries of the Tauren. The Tauren convinced Thrall to let them join the Horde with the logic that it would give the Horde a foothold in the Eastern Kingdoms
- As the party makes their way to the gates of Orgrimmar, they see a sea of tents: a war camp.

- The party sees thousands upon thousands of soldiers gathered at the gates of Orgrimmar. The amassing army is comprised of orcs, trolls, blood elves, goblins, and taurens. The Blood elves are few and far between, and have very posh tents. There are catapults, metal humanoid contraptions with sawblade and three finger claw arms.
- Inside the gates is a celebratory atmosphere. It is still the Feast of Wintervale, though it is the last day. There are festival goers with fluffy white hats, and sea of colored clothing. The whole valley smells of spices and baked goods.
- A small older goblin man with puffed out hair and sideburns dressed in heavy furs advertises his cart of wacky eccentricities. The party immediately b-lines for this and buys from him celebones, an oops stone, and an invisibility ring (single use).
- The desert is pretty cold this time of year, around 35 degrees
- The gang bullies a small goblin child trying to make a living on the shell game, and then Isi wins Addie a candied apple <3
- Addie cheats on the hammer game but it's fine.
- Alyrin sits on Mall Santa's lap and gets a sketch of it. She leaves a nice tip for the poor overworked artist while the rest of the gang get food and Adelaide gets a dreidel.
- In a game of archery, Isilee wins two rats that she names A’thian and Ga’an. Juniper wins dolls to send to her parents, while Adelaide gets a Sylvanas doll and reminsices about childhood dreams of becoming a Farstrider.
- The party meet Teja, a troll from the mercenary group calling themselves the Gutter Rats. She informs the party of a grand tournament taking place in the Hall of the Brave. She fills the party in that the war began with the disappearnce of the human king Varian Wryne, which the Alliance blamed on the Horde.
- The Gutter Rats have been working out of the crossroads escorting caravans for the war effort. They've mostly contended with centaur and quillboar raiding parties.
- The Gaytekeepërs make their way to the Hall of the Brave and find they've missed the registration period. They name drop Madam Marem to get themselves on the list last minute. They are ushered inside where they meet a very self-important Orc man with a golden tusk.
- Isilee spies on a meeting where she overhears that Warsong Lumber Camp has fallen due to the "damn night elves" and others of the alliance. Lady Proudmoore (assumably Jaina and not her mother) has requested to meet with the Warchief.
- The Gaytekeepërs are brought into the prep room. There, they see the other groups of adventures including the Gutter Rats, as well as two young shaman.
- The party discusses strategy and collaboration, particularly about focusing on one target at a time.
- The tournament begins acknowledging the esteemed leadership present at the event, including Thrall, the high shaman of the Horde, and "regent lord of Quel'thalas, Lor'themar Theron". He is a Blood Elf with one blazing emerald green eye. The other eye has a long dark scar passing through it.
- This announcement is news to Isilee and Adelaide that Kael'thas is no longer the leader of the Blood Elves. Adelaide knows of Lor'themar, having met him in passing on several occasions while attending dinners with her father. He was once a Farstrider, second in command to Sylvannas.
- The tournament is held in a round pit, with an iron cage to protect the crowd. The Gaytekeepërs battle their way through three fights and emerge victorious alongside the Gutter Rats. The Horde leaders all make their way to congratulate the winners. Lor'themar says "very impressive" to the group, but nothing else. He looks over them, and his eye twitches in a second of recognition when he sees Adelaide. He leaves with Thrall and Farseer.

- The party retires to the Broken Tusk Tavern to celebrate their victory.
- Isilee convinces Morag to give them the room for free, as a discount for the fact that they were attacked viciously in the night the last time that they stayed there.
- While the group is feasting on raptor meats and pumpkin spice waffles, Isilee and Alyrin notice some orcs in the corner watching them surreptitiously.
- Isilee volunteers to go check it out, and goes over to the orcs. They immediately try but fail to spell her, suggesting she go to room 4 of Dark Earth tavern as they had some business with her they wanted to take care of.
- Isilee returns to the table and alerts the rest of the party to this problem. A plan is conceived where Isilee will set out without the rest of the party, who will sneak down to the Cleft of Shadows and follow her invisibly behind. Isi will take Lu'va with her so Adelaide can see where she is.
- This plan is enacted, and Isi leaves for the cleft. The rest of the party finishes their food and then heads after her.
- Upon Isi's arrival at the tavern, she attempts to interact with a whittling troll that does not want to talk to her. She rents a room up front with the owner, and inquires about the orcs that told her to come there, but is met with resistance as this would be a breach of privacy. She heads back to the room, where she is greeted by rat dung and another spell, which compels her to allow herself to be tied up by some elves that enter the room after her. Lu'va is dispelled.
- Isilee is interrogated by her former boss, Cinder Sharpflyer, about her business with Ravenhold and the Syndicate.
- It is revealed that Cinder received a burn notice from Isilee's fiancé Pietro, detailing her double-cross and alleging that she spied on the Syndicate and was working against Blades of the Sun.
- Isilee defended herself, claiming that she never worked against Blades of the Sun, but did spy on the Syndicate without being told to by Cinder, and further did not contact him after running away.
- The rest of the party sneaks to the Cleft, where they pause to wait as Alyrin makes them invisible. She does, and Adelaide attempts to use the ring of invisibility that she purchased from the cart merchant in the last session. Much to the party's chagrin, the ring turns invisible, and nothing else happens. Adelaide resolves to use her Lu'vavision to work out where Isilee is being held. Alyrin and Juniper go forward toward the tavern, while Ga'an and Adelaide stay behind.
- Alyrin is unable to open the door, as it has been locked since after Isilee arrived. She attempts to use the magic key she obtained before, but it does not work. She then uses one of the patches off the robe of useful items and installs a new iron door like two feet away from the other door, and enters invisibly through that. This scares and inspires the tavern keeper.
- Adelaide attempts to connect to Lu'va but finds that she has difficulty doing so. She begins to blindly walk toward the tavern to see if she can get within range (not knowing if Lu'va has been dispelled or not). She is unable to connect, and Dimension Doors herself and Ga'an into the tavern successfully. However, the second that she arrives, she is attacked by none other than Kanyi, a troll she worked with on her side adventure with Jes'rimon.
- Kanyi immediately heals Adelaide and chastises her for coming. She then tells her that if any other members of the party are there to reveal themselves.
- At this point, Ga'an, Alyrin, and Juniper all break invisibility, and Kanyi is like. Okay. Sure, I guess
- The group is lead to where Isi is being held. Cinder has them all drink truth serum after Juniper reminds him that he has it.
- The truth serum 'tastes like blue'
- Isilee tells Cinder she saw him as more of a creepy uncle than a dad
- Under the truth serum's influence, Isi confirms her earlier stances to Cinder, who accepts them as truth.
- Cinder asks if there is anything else he should know about, and Isi and Adelaide take the chance to tell him about the goings-on related to the Old gods and their discoveries of that nature from the First Home adventure.
- Cinder releases the party and says that he will relay their findings to Thrall.
- Isilee later reveals to the party that she did not work against Blades of the Sun, but rather wanted to leave the organization.
- The group returned to their room and split the winnings of the competition earlier before turning in for the night.
- The next day, the party engaged in rapid shopping, before Ga'an went to meet with the shamans in the Valley of Spirits to bring them the Axe of Shirvallah and discuss with them the events that went on at First Home.

- Adelaide leads Isilee, Alyrin, and Juniper to Coifcurl Spa in the Valley of Wisdom.
- The spa offers many treatments, including mud baths, massages, and shamman IBS treatment.
- The girls treat themselves and emerge clean, shiny, and with killer hair
- Isilee tries to dip her rats in mud and one (Ga’an) bites her and escapes. She mentions this to the owner, who is definitely going to fire an innocent employee now.
- During the mud bath, Adelaide confides in the others about the secrecy of bladesinging and her theft of a bladesinger textbook when she wasn’t selected for the program
- Everyone agrees it’s probably fine and won’t come back to bite us in the tooshie.
- Part two of Girls Day™ is clothing shopping at Magar’s Cloth Goods! Isi negotiates the price down for a sponsorship contract.
- The tailor, Magar Irontusk, doesn’t like logos, thinks it's tacky (fair). The party will advertise through word of mouth instead.
- The girls pay half now, half later (40 now, 40 later)
- The party meets up with Ga’an who has been waiting outside the Cleft of Shadows since speaking to the witchdoctors
- While waiting, Ga’an overhears guards discussing an escort job to the Crossroads. The job involves fighting quillboars and pays pretty well. It is sponsored by the military
- The Gaytekeepers stop in at Madam Maram’s, who is pleased by the publicity the party has stirred up for her. Her stock is low because of the conflict (and popularity spurred by the Gaytekeepers)
- Adelaide inquires about items which allow for more prepared spells. Maram did have a ring of spell storage, which was bought by a blood elven woman.
- This woman turns out to be one of the elves involved in Isi’s kidnapping, Satashia
- Maram offers the party a job: she has beef with another magic shop owner who one upped her with an acquisition.
- The item is a ring with a blue gem, though Maram would not say its purpose
- The ring was bought (before Maram could acquire it) by Enchanter Farendin Manaflame at Godan’s Runeworks
- Farendin is a recent arrival from Silvermoon and fails to recognize the way things are done in Orgrimmar
- Godan has felt empowered by him, and Farendin needs to be put in his place
- The party negotiates a price of 1500 gp + 1 alchemist fire + 1 spice pouch
- Payment is contingent upon the job going smoothly (i.e., the theft can’t be linked back to her)
- If the ring is obtained in this scenario, the party must still provide it to Maram
- If the ring is not provided to Maram, the party will not be able to set foot in Orgrimmar again (on threat of death)
- Maram gives the Gaytekeepers one week to think on the job and perform any reconnaissance, after that, the job will be given to another party.
- Back at the inn, many plans are thrown around, including polymorphing Farendin into a worm and Isilee distracting him in disguise as a suitor.
- Ga’an and Isilee also speak briefly about being chosen of the loa
- Adelaide shows the rest of the party the puzzle ball, and tries to identify it (unsuccessfully)
- Ga’an inspects it, noting the polished platinum with rings of gold filigree, impossibly small and intricate engravings, and a faint purplish-blue glow through one of the grooves
- The button to create coins jams, though more pieces of the puzzle present themselves
- Adelaide progresses the puzzle until a new button is revealed.
- The new button creates 7 garnets, 3 corals, and 1 jade before it jams.
- Alyrin tries to remove curse, nothing happens
- Isilee is concerned for Adelaide’s safety, believing the puzzle ball to be dangerous, but Addie says she has it under control.
- The next morning, Isilee goes in disguise as a blood elf soldier to seduce Farendin
- Isi stealthily throws A’thian the rat under the back curtain in Godan’s shop, then yells after the rat and chases him through the curtain.
- A blood elven man in green robes has cast hold on the rat, and asks Isi to take it and leave
- Isi unsuccessfully tries to flirt first with Farendin, then with Godan. She learns that Farendin is happily married and lives with his wife, and is asked to leave the store.
- She then tries to ask about “Stacy Manaflame” at Yelmak’s but is met with confused looks.
- Whuut now has glasses to correct his colorblindness, good for him.
- Meanwhile, Alyrin and Adelaide go to the gem store and have several gems identified.
- Alyrin once again moonlight calms one of the elf twins, though it is unclear which.
- Back at the inn, Adelaide progresses the puzzle further and finds a knob which creates a two foot wide black hole in the ground.
- Some investigation reveals it is a portal to a pocket room with a pile of magical items
- One ladder patch and several shenanigans later, Isi emerges with several items of non-magical clothes(a fur coat embroidered with the letter “E” and boots), a wizard’s staff, and a rod of hand-warming
- More of the puzzle has opened up now, and the purple-blue glow can be seen clearly through large cracks in the mechanism.

- The session begins with the party debating the pros and cons of the heist. Isi, Ga'an, and Alyrin plan to scout the shop and invisibly trail Farendin back to his home so Ga'an can cast Locate Object.
- The shop (Godan’s Rune Works) is built against cliff edge so there is no back entrance. Isi instead tries to sneakily look in window, and Ga'an decides to mention after already reaching the shop that he doesn't have Locate Object prepared.
- Farendin notices Alyrin and Isi in the alley and calls for guards when he sees them turn invisible. The guard's response is quick, as the guard post is right next to Godan's. Farendin casts Detect Magic and points to where Isi and Alyrin are standing.
- Alyrin rolls a nat 20 to stealth away but Isi has no such luck. She drops invisibility and lies that their suspicious activity was them trying to conceal their affair, a ploy that somehow succeeds. Farendin warns her that he should never see her again, before portalling away.
- Isi and Alyrin eventually make their way back to the tavern and fill the group in on what happened. The party takes some shots and Ga'an dares Adelaide to keep exploring the puzzle ball. This results in the whole party being sucked into the ball, finding themselves in a dimly lit pentagonal room with marble flooring. Around the room are five pillars on a raised decagon dias, which the party landed on.
- There are five banners draping down to the floor from about 12ft up. Their colors are blue, black, green, red, and orange-green. A stylized elvish E is stylized in gold thread on the banner. Two figures additional figures are in the room, mummified Night Elf corpses. One is standing while the other lies on the floor.
- Detect magic reveals the room to be "oozing" conjuration, and all the banners are magical.
- Emblazoned on chest is symbol of eye
- The standing figure appears to have been magically aged to the point of death. The prone figure has been petrified.
- Behind green banner is a statue of tree like figure (Tree Ent) with mouth agape and green gems for eyes. It is lifelike though it is made from stone. A poisonous fog releases from its mouth as soon as the banner is lifted.
- Adelaide casts tiny hut while the others investigate the room. Ga'an conjures Chadow to have him lift banners. The red shoots flame, the blue causes cold damage but conceals a door. Ga'an casts Dispel Magic and Alyrin uses her magical key to unlock the door.
- The party hold hands as they walk through the door, and notice the eye sigil start to reglow as they leave.
- The door leads to a narrow hallway in a slanted tunnel. The path feels spiral. It eventually opens into a marble chamber, 70 ft tall and filled with books, cabinets, and a massive stained glass window. Everything in the room is of elven design.
- A map of the planes hangs on the wall. Directly across is a doorway made of Atwood. The door is shut and has a large glowing yellow gem
- The spine of each book is blank. A metal clasp on each book keeps its position. A few books are clearly missing from the shelves. Each book is locked in place.
- The party spots a beautiful purple leather tomb with gold and sapphires laid upon the spine
- On the table is a coffee cup which is cold, but not moldy. A book on table is covered in similar silver clasp. A golden globe shows the world as all ocean with just one continent.
- Juniper inspects stained glass, finds small glowing purple gem (amethyst) in the middle. As Juniper takes it out, there is a shattering noise and juniper is gone. One blank picture now has image of arcane academy that we saw underwater.
- The other blank picture coalesces into older night elven man with purple skin, black robes with silver trim, silver hair with beard and pointed eyebrows. His eyes are a burning purplish magenta. Dark purple tattoos on his face, a gem on his forehead. A solid silver necklace seems to levitate an inch off his shoulders.
- Adelaide touches the gem Juniper vanished in front of to identify, is sucked in. Isi, then Alyrin and Ga'an follow.
- Cut to Juniper, falling through a wormhole. She lands in a chamber full of bone fragments. The chamber splits into 5 passage ways, one with dead end and an orb.
- A large reptilian head rests atop a heap of treasure. The dragon lifts its head and questions Juniper. He says the "Edel has not returned in ages" and that he hungers. He attacks and Juniper holds her own until the rest of the party arrives. Adelaide polymorphs the Wyrm into a Worm, and shoves him into the bag of holding. This succeeds in killing him, with the unfortunate side effect of destroying the bag of holding and releasing all the contents into the astral plane.

- The session begins with the party examining their surroundings in the dragon's room. There are five statues of dragons clutching giant gems. Two dragons have glowing eyes (one orange, one black).
- At the other end of the room is an alter. On it is a raised pillar holding an orb with five fingers.
- Also around the room are vast quantities of gold, jewelry, and various magical items which the group distributes amongst themselves. Alyrin takes the armor of acid resistance(?) and the cloak of displacement. Juniper takes the ring of fire resistance. Adelaide takes the amulet of health. Isi (?) takes the wand of web.
- Isilee is able to unlock one of the books taken from the study. Alyrin is able to read it as it is written in Darnassian. The book contains public debate records from the Forum of Almenalor in the year 1044 of the Highborne Dynasty. It discusses the ethics of arcane experimentation on troll prisoners and warnings of enraging the wild god spirits they pray to. The book contains transcripts of multiple days of debates about Zuldara trolls, the breaking of the Zandalari Empire and how trolls are useful for arcane research. It also theorizes on the origination of Loa and ways of harnessing them.
- After an embarrassing amount of time, the party realizes the five statues need to be made to glow the five colors of the dragon flight with spells representing the five domains. This activates the orb, which the party all touch at the same time, landing them in Madam Marum's tent.

- The party has crash landed on the floor of Marum's tent. They spot a table on a pedestal, holding up the puzzle sphere. Marum and her assistant, a light blue skinned troll with fiery red hair (Jaboon) comes into the room and demand to know what's going on.
- Discourse ensures but tldr Marum insists its hers now because someone brought it to her from the Broken Tusk Tavern (the party was in the ball for 12-13 days). The party, but agree to come back during the day time to discuss further. Isi steals a crystal orb on the way out.
- On the way back, there is a noticeably larger guard presence in the cleft of shadows. The party decides to spend the night at Miwanna's Longhouse.
- In the morning, the group drops off gold at the bank before heading to the Broken Tusk. Questioning Morag and her niece goes nowhere.
- Juniper & Alyrin go to the post office while the others go to the flight tower and meet an Orc named Doras who speaks incredibly slowly. The trip will take 1.5-2 days on Wyvern-back. There are enough wyverns if Isi and Adelaide share. It will be 70 GP per wyvern. Airships and waterships are also looked into, but are slower.
- The party stops in at Godan's and buys a haversack of holding. They also place an order for a bag of holding, which will be ready on feb 8th at the earliest. 2000 GP is put down and 2000 GP more will be due on receipt of the item.
- Juniper speaks to Isi's rat and attempts to free him, but Isi rolls a nat 20 to catch him.
- The plan to smooth things over with Marum goes horribly wrong and the group gets stuck in a blood contract with her. Adelaide might need to call in some favors in Silvermoon to break the contract.
- Adelaid gets very very drunk and shares information on how she ran away from school because she was rejected from the bladesingers program. She also mutters the name "Iyllsa".
- Juniper successfully releases Garfunkle the rat on her second try.
- Isi goes to the Spirit Lodge to speak to Alortha No Shadra.
- The next day, the party leaves to fly to Zoram’gar in Ashenvale (which is just south of Felwood). From there it will be a 5 day journey to the firbolg village. The Felwood used to be a lush forest, but was corrupted during the 3rd war.

- The party has flown west across the Southfury River, crossing the savannah.
- Doras rides Fluffy, Isilee and Adelaide share Fuzzy, Juniper rides Bot, Ga'an rides Mittens, and Alyrin is on Slagathor.
- While flying over the Stonetalon Mountains, they notice interruptions in the pine forest. What was once a dense forest with streams and a lake are now peppered with houses and huts. Large plumes of smoke rise from within the basin. Small figures walk throughout, as well as strange contraptions that are humanoid in shape but don't move normally which aid in cutting down the wood.
- The party lands in the woods for the night. They feel similar to first home in the ancient, awing feeling. Alyrin feels that it is familiar yet off. Doras states that the Night Elves keep their distance from this place, which is why this is a relatively safe location to make camp.
- Nearby the landing spot is a darkened lake with a small island at the center. Doras has not personally been but scouted small ruins that he hasn't investigated. Lu'va goes to scout with the help of Juniper's Darkvision spell, but predictably rolls horribly on both stealth and perception.
- There is the noise of something diving into the water, but Lu'va doesn't see the source.
- The island is about 70ft in diameter. All around are the lights of blue orbs hovering a few feet off the ground. These are wisps, but they are not aggressive. The orbs have an almost ethereal face with elven features inside. The spirits of night elves are said to inhibit the woods of Kalimdor. This is where they return after death.
- The foliage on the island is different than the surrounding forest. There seems to be a sickness to the island; the leaves are darkened, younger tress have sprouted out with sickly roots, and the bushes and shrubs have blackened. One exception: clustered flowers of white seem to be unaffected by the other plants' illness.
- Ancient marble columns surround a structure with a Tori Gate-esque roof and dais. In the center of the dais is a cracked bowl filled with putrid water. Inscriptions are carved into the bowl and surrounding stone. Six columns, two of which have collapsed, hold up a ring above. The architecture is definitely Night Elven. The whole gazebo is overgrown with ivy and appears to be incredibly old.
- This structure is known as a Moonwell, and is very important in Night Elven culture. It is a font if magical power and a means by which Elune can bestow power onto the elves. It is used for rituals, religious practices, etc. They are always highly cared for and maintained due to their sacred nature. They are believed to be the spots where Elune's tears touched Kalimdor. Astrenar is a nearby Elven settlement, which should be maintaining this Moonwell.
- When Lu'va returns, the party ask about the constructs they spotted during the day. Doras explains that it was the Venture Company in Windshear Crag, a group of mercenaries. They hire humans, dwarves, black iron dwavers, ogres, orcs, and even gnolls. The party is warned to stay clear of them.
- Isilee convinces Duras to leave later in the day tomorrow so the party can check out the island. The Gaytekeepers go for a night swim to the island. On the island there is a reptilian figure on four legs, a small green dragon. They are sacred and work with Night Elf druids as protectors of the Emerald Dream. This dragon seems to be only a wyrmling (a baby), which would only speak Draconic and cannot really communicate.
- The wyrmling spooks when it spots the party and dives into the water, disappearing under the island. Alyrin jumps in after and follows after. She resurfaces into a cave. Tracks lead deeper into the cave, which Alyrin follows to find two dragons which hiss at her, kicking off initiative.
- Isilee follows after Alyrin, nearly drowning. There are actually four dragons in the cave.
- Meanwhile, the rest of the crew investigate the top of the island. The white flowers are Stardust Flowers and are resilient to the island's sickness. The Moonwell bowl contains transmutation magic. A face comes out of the bowl, attacking Adelaide. Its a Banshee!
- Both groups get their asses handed to them, with Adelaide aging 10 years and the flowers also attacking the party. But they live!
- Alyrin manages to break the curse on several dragons. Their eyes go from black eyes with pulsing veins to a healthy looking yellow. Alyrin offers the wyrmlings a fish as a peace offering.

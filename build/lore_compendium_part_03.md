# Full Notes
- In the cavern is a portal showing a realm of green beyond. The wyrmling describes it as “where we came from”. It is inferred to be the Emerald Dream
- Through the portal, Isi and Alryin can see tar-like water and tentacle-like protrusions wrapping around boughs of trees.
- On the trees that the tentacles touch are glowing red shards, and odd growths which are masses of bone, flesh, and teeth. Slits in the growths open up into yellow eyes
- The masses shriek and pull their way towards where the tear is.
- Alyrin is unsuccessful in her attempt to convince the wyrmlings to leave with them. The wyrmlings grow more aggressive and clearly become re-cursed from stepping in the sludge.
- Alyrin and Isi flee, swimming back to the surface to reunite with the rest of the party.
- The gang investigates the moonwell more now that the banshees are gone. The water in the basin is scummy, reminiscent of pond water.
- Around the marble basin is an inscription in ancient elvish “speak her oath whilst her gaze is fully upon thee for only then shall she reveal her gift”. The “oath” refers to the Sentinel Prayer:
Through her light we are protected
Her love we embrace
In her wrath we are strengthened
Our foes we erase
Life and Death
Wax and Wane
Through her gift we are reborn
Elune be with us
- Alyrin says the prayer, but nothing happens. This likely must be done under a full moon.
- The group returns to the camp and requests Doras’ map of ashenvale, which Adelaide is able to duplicate.
- For 125 GP, Doras is willing to stay the extra two days until the full moon arrives.
- Doras will stay here for two days for 125 gold.
- The party’s plan is to try and fix the Moonwell during the full moon, and potentially investigate the Emerald Dream portal if it seems to be cured by the Moonwell’s restoration
- Adelaide and isi have a heart to heart, while on watch. Adelaide explains the situationship she had with Iyllsa and why she was so upset about having to go home.
- In the morning, Ga’an wakes up and finds giant reptilian footprints on the ground that apparently went unnoticed on watch. It appears that a dragon was right outside of the Tiny Hut, unnoticed by Isi and Adelaide.
- We successfully stealth to the edge of the lake, find a group of different footprints
  - Juniper identifies them as 4 sets of dragon tracks leading away from lake. Medium-larger creature.
- Ga’an casts underwater breathing
- Now in the cave, we see a variety of tracks the same size as the ones by the lake front
- Cave seems to echo with the sound of ominous heavy breathing
- Isi steps into the bubbling, blackened sludge
  - It starts to move as isi steps into it
- Heavy deep breathing has changed -- was just aroused by the fighting
  - Its a dragon wyrmling
- We fight and kill all four wyrmlings, RIP
- We enter the goo room and alyrin gets goo’d. She is KO’d and absorbed into goo
- Juniper pulls alyrin’s body out. Alyrin loses two death saves but stabilizes at the start of her turn thanks to the periapt
- Isi one hit KOs the goo but theres more goo coming out of the portal and two dragons back the way we came
- Isi and the shadows take care of the dragons while ga’an manages to close the portal just in time
- Webbing across walls of the room with a slow pulse, not seeming to react to our presence. Isi firebolts it and sears it away. Addie joins her and together they scorch away the unnatural growths
- Each egg is sitting in pools of black webbing ichor
- Two are freshly hatched
- Adelaide melts the web off the egg but the baby dragon is still cursed and in critical condition
  - We stabilize him and short rest
  - As we’re resting, another hatches
  - Isi fails to pretend to be a dragon and gets poisoned

- Retcon of morning:
  - Team discussion on whether to continue on to Zoram Gar
    - Alyrin initially wanted to continue procrastinate going home and wanted to go to Zoram Gar “for intel gathering”
    - Isi makes a joke about things to steal at the outpost
    - The group immediately decides that isi cannot be allowed near a town for the time being and its decided to have Doras go on while we take the road by raynewood retreat (quicker route)
  - Doras is knitting a hat for Fluffy, in Fluffy’s favorite color, beige
    - Juniper makes a flower crown out of late bloomers and moss
- Team swam back to island to debrief
- Alyrin’s bad dream about brother involved emerald dream, there were bad vibes and Elune said things are bad you gotta go help
  - Alyrin also had heard that issues were happening with druids and the dream
- In Night Elf Religion, its thought that when you die, you join Elune as a star. The white flowers (Stardust Blossom) are significant in their association with that as they are believed to be remnants that the ancestors leave behind
  - Very holy, considered to have warding powers against evil
  - Alyrin takes a little bite of one (just a lil bite)
    - Feels something very subtle that she can’t place initially
    - There’s a sweet flavor (something that Alyrin hasn’t really tasted since dying)
    - Tiny bit of a burn after taste, soft but abrasive
- Back at camp, the gang:
  - Ga’an does some alchemy on the flowers, makes a vial of Stardust Essence
  - Isi works on some poisons and then podcasts her thoughts on Tusk Love
  - Alyrin thinks about what will happen to her soul now that she’s a forsaken, will she still be able to join Elune as other night elves do?
  - Adelaide meditates and attunes to the leylines, also contemplating mortality. She senses a well of mana, similar to how the sunwell once felt but a calmer, cooler light. The source of this is to the north-east, but it is not too distant from here (definitely not Silvermoon)
  - Juniper goes hunting (after confirming that its not violating a holy site). She finds a beautiful white deer and prepares to shoot it
    - Hears a voice say “drop the bow”
- She drops it
- “Turn around slowly”
- 5 figures, humanoid, clad in ceremonial metallic armor
- Each have long colorful hair in different braids and warpaint, glowing eyes
- Each has a giant glave (shuriken like, can be thrown, doubles as shield)
- Behind them is a giant cat/puma with a harness, a night elf is riding it
- Juniper is accused of being a spy, bound and gagged and led back to the night elf camp. She does her best to leave noticeable tracks as she walks and keeps good track of her location
- She is brought to a Night Elven military outpost, all of her belongings are taken
- She is told that the captain will see her soon
- Meanwhile, its now been awhile since we’ve seen Juniper
  - Isi tries to message her on the sending stone, no response
  - Looking around, Isi notices that there is another owl next to Scintilla, watching the group
  - It flies away when the group spots it and Alyrin sends Scintilla after
  - Scintilla follows the owl back to two night elves but is seen by them
- The group now knows that the night elves know theyre there
- We continue following the tracks, find the area where Juniper was kidnapped
- We follow the tracks to the camp, but the camp seems dead
  - Everyone except isi is doing a bad job talking quietly about our bomb plan
- Isi decides to go off on her own and look for juniper
  - Finds a tree with an office like set up and a spiral staircase leading up somewhere
- Juniper interrogation goes poorly, is unable to convince the captain that shes not a threat
  - Isi sneaks in and goes to untie her
  - 4 guards who were invisible and standing guard go un-invisible
- Alyrin announces herself and is accused of being a traitor
  - Adelaide drops her rapier, isi comes out of hiding
- Alyrin calls down moonlight and starts avatar form to demonstrate that she is a servant of elune
  - She is accused of this being a falsehood
  - Clad in bright blue moonlight, she begins to chant the Sentinels prayer
  - The captain joins in, and sees Alyrin is telling the truth
  - Alyrin explains the quest that she has been given by Elune, and the corruption we encountered
    - Isi nat 20s persuasion about being no harm
- Captain- Lieutenant Aeodira Thunderseeker- sent scout to check on the nearby druid enclave
  - Scout did not return
  - Alyrin suggests the corruption may have been to blame
- Captain says she will let us go to Moonglade
  - Suggests we talk to Keeper Ordanus (Cenarious’ son) at Raynewood Retreat
    - Cenarious is a god, the son of Elune and the one who taught druidic magics to the Elves
  - Raynewood retreat is intended to keep back the corruption of the Felwood
  - Captain will give us missive granting us safe passage
- Archdruid Fandrul, leader of the cenarion circle, has not been forthcoming with the night elves about whats going on
  - Not Malfurion??
  - Malfurion has not been seen since the burning of Nordrassil
  - Many druids have disappeared into the dream, Fandrul Staghelm has taken up leadership in his stead
- We make proper introductions and they tell us they will escort us to the Ruins of Stardust tomorrow
  - We are currently at Talendeep Outpost

- Alyrin was on the JV moonball team, on a team called the Elunatics
- Moonball:
  - Naruto-style tree top dodgeball, if you get hit it splatters you with paint
- Dark side of elune
  - Similar to manhunt, but when only one person is left, it goes into challenge mode where the chasers cant use their hands

- Effective immediately, moonball is banned at the outpost
- Our escorts are Aimer and Aila (seems to be roughly middle aged)
- We start off, taking the main road
- After about an hour, something feels off
  - We feel like something is off

- We’re close to enemy territory, which is marked by the river boundary
- The whole group goes to investigate this, moving stealthily

- Combat ensues, the scout is brought down, but Alyrin is killed by the orc captain 🙁
- Its implied that Aila, aimer, and talia (?) were family
- Aila will go back to report on whats happened, but then will rejoin us for the way to moonglade
- We prepare a litter and put Alyrins body on it
- Lieutenant Aeodira Thunderseeker returns with several soldiers, she will personally escort us to Moonglade and pay her respects to Alyrin
- Faltharan river marks the border between horde and alliance territories
- We make it safely to the island, avoiding a horde caravan and firbolgs of greenpaw village, part of the felwheel tribe
  - Firbolgs were once allies of the night elves, but the corruption has made them attack anyone on sight, including firbolgs of other tribes
- Isi and Juniper dig a grave while ga’an and adelaide prepare the body (ga’an does the heavy lifting of the gory stuff)

- Slowly, evidence of corruption begins to burn away
- AND ALYRIN COMES BACK TO LIFE OH MY GOD

- Isi tries to stay up to protect Alyrin but falls asleep immediately. Over the course of the night, she scooches closer and closer, eventually just fully spooning her
- There's a vibrancy to the area now. Before, it felt off, spooky. Now there’s vibrance, especially to the plant life. The wisps are significantly more numerous, dancing like fireflies around the night
- In the morning, Alyrin beelines for the food. It’s the first time she can smell and taste food in years. And this is the food she grew up on
- As a reminder, Juniper’s goodberries taste like ranch. Its part of tauren culture.

- She has vine-like hair with flowers growing in it and long pointed ears.

- Adelaide poofs to the top floor and overhears a debate.
- A man hears a deeper voice, saying he shouldn’t be waiting up in a tower since he is the son of Cenarius.
